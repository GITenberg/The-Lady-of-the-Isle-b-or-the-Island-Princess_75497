</div>

<p class='c006'>In offering you this, the most singular romance
that I have ever written, I feel constrained to say,
that the most remarkable characters and incidents
here exhibited, are drawn from well-known persons
and events of real life. These circumstances are
here presented with only such judicious change of
times, places, and proper names, as is dictated by
the prudence and delicacy which also withholds me
from pointing out more definitely the sources whence
they were derived.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It was the first of May, the marriage day of the Viscount
Montressor, of Montressor Castle, Dorsetshire, and
Estelle, only daughter and heiress of Sir Parke Morelle,
Hyde Hall, Devonshire.</p>

<p class='c013'>A glorious morning! the cloudless, blue sky smiled down
upon the green hills and dewy dales and deep woods of
Devon; and the park around the Hall was all alive and
musical with the joyous songs of birds, and the merry
laughter of young men and maidens gathering to celebrate
their May-day festival, and to do honor to the marriage of
their landlord’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The elm-shaded, winding avenue that led from the highway
to the house, was arched at each terminus by a mammoth
wreath of flowers, and many were the carriages that
passed under them, on their way to assist at the wedding;
and these contained only the bridesmaids, and the nearest
friends and relatives of the family, whose relationship or
position gave them the right to attend the bride to church;—for
a still more numerous party had been invited to meet
her at the altar. The villagers and tenants, grouped about
under the shade of the great old trees, or wandering over
the greensward on either side of the grand avenue, watched
these equipages as they rolled on, commenting—as
usual—</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is Sir William Welworth’s carriage—he is the
bride’s uncle by her mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who don’t know that?—Hush! my eyes! lend me a
rumberrell, Joe, or I shall be dazed blind, along o’ looking
at this turn out! Whose is it? since you know everything.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That?—that’s Lord Dazzleright’s—the great cove’s as
made a fortin’ and <em>riz by the law</em>—(not at a rope’s end,
though, as <em>you’ll</em> rise one of these days, Bill, my lad, if you
don’t keep out o’ the squire’s preserves)—but by reading
and pleading, and keeping on the right, do you see, of the
powers that be; until he got himself made a Baron of;—which
people <em>do</em> say he’ll get upon the woolsack yet,”
replied the gamekeeper, Joe, as the splendid equipage
of the new member of the house of peers dashed past
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; but what does he <em>he</em> do here?” inquired the laborer,
Bill.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s the god-father of the bride, you know, besides
being a bachelor without children, I mean sons-and-heirs.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here comes somethin’ like a huss—my granny! how
solemncolly! who’s comin’ to a funeral?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>“Oh let me see!—<em>that?</em> why that’s the carriage of the
old Duchess of Graveminster, the grand-aunt of Lady Morelle.
She was expected at the hall yesterday; something
must o’ stopped her,” said Joe, as a large, sombre, dark-colored
traveling carriage lumbered heavily past.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What o’clock is it, Mr. Joe? you’re a weatherwise, and
you can tell,” inquired a young girl leaving a group of
maidens and joining the two men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What o’clock, my dear?” replied the gamekeeper,
looking up at the sun with an air of confidence. “Well,
I should say it was just about a quarter to ten.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh—dear me! and the weddingers won’t pass till
nearly twelve! and here we are to wait two mortal hours!
and I want to be away at the Maypole so much.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush! my darling; look! here comes his lordship’s
carriage, itself, just as sure as you’re the prettiest lass in
the country,” whispered the gamekeeper, as a very plain
but handsome traveling carriage of dark green, drawn by
a pair of spirited grey horses, rolled on up the avenue toward
the Hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Whose</em> Lordship’s? What are you thinking about,
Mr. Joseph?” asked the little maiden, fretfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, <em>his</em> Lordship’s! <em>The</em> Lorship’s—the <em>only</em>
Lordship to be thought about now, my dear! Lord <em>Montressor’s</em>
Lordship!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now <em>that’s</em> impossible, Mr. Joseph! If you <em>be</em> gamekeeper,
you sha’n’t make game of <em>me</em>, at that rate. Lord
Montressor! Marry-come-up! What should <em>he</em>, of all
men, be doing here at <em>this</em>, of all hours?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come up to marry, I suppose. Anyhow it is <em>he</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! It can’t <em>be</em>, I tell you! It would be out
of all manners! Don’t I know? He’s to bring all his
groomsmen, and <em>his</em> friends and relations to the <em>church</em>, and
wait <em>there</em> for Miss Morelle and her friends and relations!
<em>That’s</em> manners.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>“I know it be!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That shows it can’t be Lord Montressor who drove
past just now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I know <em>it be him</em>, also! Don’t I know his Lordship’s
grey and crimson liveries? and his co’t arms—the lion
<em>couchant</em>, and the lady <em>sittin on’t</em>? It’s <em>him</em>, now just as
sure as you are just the sweetest creetur in the world; but
what I be thinking of is—<em>what’s to pay?</em> It looks like
somethin’ was <em>on</em>regular!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Onreglar? I believe you! Who ever heard of such a
thing?—if it <em>be</em> Lord Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early that morning a note from his affianced bride had
been put in his hands, summoning him to a private conference
with her at the Hall before they should proceed to the
church. Surprised and filled with vague uneasiness, his
lordship lost no time in obeying the behest.</p>

<p class='c013'>And it was really his carriage and liveries that passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within the most secluded of her suite of richly-furnished
apartments at the old Hall, half buried in the depths of a
cushioned chair, reclined the bride expectant, in bridal
array.</p>

<p class='c013'>On her right, a gorgeous cheval mirror reflected in profile
her beautiful form.</p>

<p class='c013'>On her left, through the rose-colored silk hangings of the
half-open bay window, wafted by the breeze, came glimpses
of the pure blue sky and tender green foliage of spring,
scents of fragrant flowers, and sounds of singing birds and
innocent laughter, from the park.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was alone, her attendants having, by her own desire,
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle Morelle—or “La belle Estelle,” “Beautiful Stella,”
“the Midnight Star”—as, for her resplendent dark beauty,
she was poetically named—was at this time twenty-five
years of age, and more lovely than a poet’s or an artist’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>ideal. Her form was of medium height, and very slender,
though well-rounded, with a graceful head, over which fell
rich masses of jet-black, silken ringlets, shading a face of
pure, pale olive complexion, with large, mournful, dark eyes,
habitually vailed by the long, drooping lashes, and delicate,
though full curved lips, ever patiently closed as in silent
resignation. The prevailing expression of her dark, brilliant
countenance was a profound melancholy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The announcement of Miss Morelle’s approaching marriage
with the Viscount Montressor had created a profound
sensation in the fashionable and aristocratic circles. A
peerless beauty, the only child and heiress of the oldest,
wealthiest and haughtiest baronet in the West of England,
her heart had been as much the object of aspiration to the
youthful and ardent, as her hand and fortune had been the
end of desire to the mercenary and ambitious.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the early age of seven years, Estelle had been placed
at one of the first-class female institutions of learning at
Paris, then as now, considered among the very best of their
kind in the world, and there had been left to remain until
her sixteenth year, when the sudden and calamitous breaking
up of the institution, and her own severe illness, had
occasioned her removal. That illness had been attended
with marked changes in the constitution and temperament
of the young girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle, previously the most careless, light-hearted and
capricious of children, left her chamber of convalescence a
subdued, thoughtful, melancholy woman! The laughing
lips of girlhood closed in patient sadness; the sparkling
eyes sheathed their beams under long, shadowy lashes, now
seldom lifted; the silvery, elastic voice, sank into deep and
thrilling tones; the free, glad motions were measured and
controlled.</p>

<p class='c013'>She never entered another school, but completed her
education under the best masters, at home. To dissipate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>what was considered a transient melancholy, her parents
traveled with her over Europe, pausing at each capital and
chief town, to show her all that was interesting and instructive.
But, though their daughter repaid their attentions
with the sweetest gratitude, and obeyed them with the
gentlest docility, she showed no interest in the passing
scenes. And though everywhere her extreme beauty and
sweetness of disposition, not less than her fortune and position,
drew around her many friends and admirers, Estelle
remained alone in her isolated thoughts and feelings.
Every most distinguished physician in Europe had been
consulted upon her case, and the result of their wisdom
was a decision that this melancholy was not the effect of
ill health, still less of secret sorrow, but that it was a constitutional
phase that would probably pass away with maturing
years.</p>

<p class='c013'>They returned to England, presented their daughter at
court, and introduced her into all the gayeties of fashionable
life. But with no happy effect upon the spirits of Estelle,
who remained profoundly unmoved amid the <em>eclat</em> that
greeted her <em>debut</em>. Her picturesque beauty was the theme
of all tongues—her mournful glance was fascinating—her
deep tones thrilling—her touch magnetic; all felt her
power, yet she who could move all others, remained unimpressed.
She who sought no conquests, for that very reason
perhaps, made many. A peer and two commoners, in succession,
laid their fortunes at her feet, and were in turn
kindly and firmly rejected.</p>

<p class='c013'>So passed her first season in London, at the close of
which her parents took her down to their seat in Devonshire.
Here, in her thoughtful, quiet, unostentatious
manner, she engaged in works of benevolence among the
villagers and the tenantry. And her father, hoping much
from this employment, gave her full liberty of action, and
smiled to see that she seemed less pensive than before.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>At the beginning of the parliamentary term, the family
went up to London.</p>

<p class='c013'>And it was here in her second season in town that Estelle
formed the acquaintance of Lord Montressor, a young
nobleman but lately acceded to his titles and estates, but
already known as a man of the most high-toned moral and
intellectual excellence, as a righteous as well as a rising
statesman, and as one, who in the event of a change of ministry,
would be likely to be called to fill a high official position
in His Majesty’s new cabinet. Aside from the glare
of rank and wealth and power, Charles Montressor was a
glorious specimen of the Creator’s workmanship. Above
the average standard of height among his countrymen,
broad shouldered and deep-chested, with a noble head, and
a face full of wisdom and goodness, his appearance truly
indicated the warm benevolence, clear intelligence, and pure
spirit of the man. His presence soon inspired Estelle with
a faith which she had not been able to feel in any other that
approached her. He drew nearer to her than any other
had been permitted to come; he crossed the magic circle
of her isolation and conversed with her as no other had
been allowed to do. The world looked and said that the
beautiful Stella had at last met her master and was conquered.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this stage of affairs, the parliamentary term being
over, Sir Park Morelle and his family left London for Hyde
Hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor asked and received permission to follow
them, and in less than a month availed himself of the privilege
to do so. Thus it was in the home of her ancestors,
after having obtained the cordial sanction of her parents,
and believing himself sure of the affections of their
daughter, Lord Montressor offered his heart and hand to
the lovely Estelle, and was, to his profound astonishment,
instantly and firmly rejected! In thus rejecting his suit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>she wept long and bitterly, praying his forgiveness, that the
happiness she had experienced and exhibited in his society
should have betrayed him into making this declaration, and
beseeching him never to renew his suit; but to leave and
forget her. There was something in the tone of her refusal
which confirmed and deepened his previous conviction that—even
in rejecting—she loved him! But with his high-toned
sentiments he would not in the least degree presume
upon that knowledge. Taking her hand with deferential
tenderness, he said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella!—a man never but once, in his whole existence,
loves a woman as I love you! I will not inquire the cause
of the rejection, which you have certainly a right to make
without assigning any reason for the act. And after having
received this repulse, I may not in honor distress you by a
renewal of my suit. But this, in parting, I must say to you—that,
though I go hence, I shall not go out of the reach
of your friends; I shall never address another woman; so
if ever in the course of future weeks, or months, or years,
however long, you may think proper to review the decision
of this evening, Stella, I implore you, do not hesitate to let
me know! Write but one word, ‘Come,’ and I return to
lay an unchanged heart at your feet!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle was weeping too bitterly to reply.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella, will you promise to do this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, best and dearest friend! Do not
seek to bind yourself to one who can give you nothing in
return! Try to think of the melancholy girl that you have
pitied and loved, only as a shadow that fell for a moment
across the sunshine of your path, and then passed away forever!—and
so forget her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella, I have pledged my honor never to renew this
suit, unless you reverse in my favor the sentence you have
pronounced upon it; but, inspired by the deep and deathless
love I bear you, and ‘hoping against hope,’ I feel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>impelled to implore before leaving you that, in the event of
a favorable change of sentiment or purpose toward me,
you will not hesitate to give me leave to return. Stella,
will you promise me so much as that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Noblest friend that I have in the world, how gladly
would I promise, but I must not, Montressor. Were I to
do so, you would feel bound to wait the changes of my
mood, and so, for a most undeserving love, might miss, in
some nobler woman’s affections, the happiness in store for
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella, will you raise your sweet, mournful eyes to mine
one moment, that you may read my soul while I speak?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle lifted her dark orbs to meet the clear, pure, blue
eyes bent with so much love and candor upon hers, and
read the deep, unchanging truth and constancy of his soul
as he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella, in the presence of the heart-searching God, who
sees and hears me, I assure you that I shall never love
another woman as I love you, and therefore, of course, can
never wed another; so that, whether you give me this
slightest of hopes or not, I am equally and forever bound!
<em>Now</em> will you promise, Stella? Remember, it is only to
let me know in case of a change in your sentiments.”</p>

<p class='c013'>For an instant the light of an unutterable love and joy
broke on her beautiful, dark face, and her smiling lips
parted to speak; when, as if a sudden memory and warning
had griped her very heart, she uttered a low, sharp cry,
turned paler than before, and then said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, my lord. Stella cannot even give you that.
She is poorer than the poorest in gifts to you. She can
only pray that you may forget her and be happy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked profoundly disappointed and troubled. But
soon mastering his despondency, he said hopefully:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, dearest Stella, although you reject me without
apparent reason, and refuse to give me the slightest promise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>or the most distant hope, yet, <em>I repeat</em>, should you, in the
long future, change your purpose, and write to me one
word—‘Come’—I will hasten to lay at your feet an unchanged
heart. Good-bye. God be with you!” and raising
her hand, he bowed over it, pressed it to his lips,
turned and left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some moments after, Lady Morelle, who came to seek
and congratulate her daughter upon what she imagined to
be the only possible result of the interview, found Estelle
lying in a swoon upon the floor. It was followed by a long
and terrible illness, terminating in a tediously protracted
convalescence. The town season was at hand before Estelle
was able to re-enter society.</p>

<p class='c013'>They went up to London, and once more the “star of
beauty” arose upon its world. And though the cloud upon
her life settled darker and heavier, day by day—though she
grew still more reserved, gloomy, and isolated—she was
more followed, flattered, and courted than before.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus three years had passed away, when one morning,
while the family, then occupying their town house in
Berkely square, were seated at a late breakfast, and Sir
Parke was engaged in reading aloud from the London
Times an account of the saving of the French ship—Le
Duc D’Anjou—wrecked off the coast of Algiers—Estelle
uttered a low cry and sank fainting from her seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>This attack was not, as the other had been, followed by
illness; on the contrary, from that day, the cloud seemed
lifted from her head, and even those who had most admired
her face in its shadow, were enchanted to see how brilliant
was her beauty in its sunshine! Her health and spirits
daily improved, yet in the midst of all this flowing tide of
new life Estelle astonished her friends by suddenly, in the
height of the London season, retiring to her father’s
country seat, where she remained in strict seclusion from
the world for eighteen months.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>At the end of this period, Lord Montressor, who had
never left England, or lost trace of his beloved Stella, and
who was now staying at his castle in Dorsetshire, was one
day seated at breakfast when the morning mail was brought
him. Among a score of letters the first that attracted his
attention was a dainty white envelope superscribed in a
delicate handwriting. He took that up first and opened it—it
contained but one word—“<span class='sc'>Come.</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>The light of an ineffable joy broke over his face! Oh!
he had waited, patiently, hopefully, years, for that word,
and at last he had received it! Thanks to Heaven in the
first instance! and then pushing all the other letters
unopened aside he sprung up, rang for his valet, and
ordered his valise packed and horses put to the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>In twenty more minutes he had reached the railway station
just as the cars were about to start, and in three hours
he was at Hyde Hall and standing in the presence of
Estelle!—she looking so beautiful and happy!</p>

<p class='c013'>With the old chivalric enthusiasm of devotion, he dropped,
at once, upon his knee, and raised her hand to his lips,
saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“For four years I have hoped and waited for one word
from you, and at last, beloved, you have written—‘Come,’
and I am at your feet, as I said, with an unchanged heart!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I,” she said, deeply blushing, while she held both
hands to raise him—“I, my Lord, have not an unchanged
heart! for longer than four years I have loved you more
than woman’s tongue may tell—and never more, than at
the hour in which we bade farewell, as I thought, forever!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, beloved! I knew it <em>then</em>! knew it <em>always</em>!
I never doubted it! Could I be deceived in the dear heart
of the woman I loved! No! and that was the secret of
my patience!” he replied, taking his seat on the sofa by her
side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And yet you never inquired, and do not even now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>inquire, why, without explanation and without hope, I sent
you from my presence, and why now, without apparent
reason, I summon you back!” she said, as a shade of the
old sadness fell upon her beautiful face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your motives, dearest, were, and are your own. Not
until your spirit move you to do so, shall you give them to
me! I have full confidence in you, beautiful Stella!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Confidence! oh my God?</em>” she exclaimed in a low, deep,
thrilling tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what is the matter, dearest?”</p>

<p class='c013'>She looked up suddenly, a smile of worshiping love,
breaking like sunlight over her dark face, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, nothing my lord! but that all your thoughts
and feelings are so elevated beyond your poor Estelle’s!
And yet she would almost choose it so! for could she be
an angel, she would wish you to be something far higher—a
god!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sweet enthusiast! moderate your aspirations, or the
world and its people will disappoint you! Be not an
idolater; worship only God, my Stella.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Such was their meeting!</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet, occasionally, throughout the interview, a sudden
shadow like the recurrence of a painful thought, would fall
upon her bright face and then pass as it came.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were engaged, and within a few days the marriage
was announced to take place on the first of May.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it was observed by the nearest friends of the bride,
that from the day of her betrothal, her spirits had been
marked by the strangest fluctuations. Sometimes with her
beautiful dark face illumined with a deep, still, almost religious
joy, she moved about as it were, on “winged feet,”
or sat brooding in a happy trance. At other times, she
fell into deep gloom and anxiety, as inexplicable as it was
alarming to her friends, who greatly feared her relapse into
the deep melancholy that had so long overshadowed her,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>and that they had grown to dread as a serious constitutional
malady. But they hoped every thing from her
approaching marriage with the man she loved. Lord
Montressor observed with the deepest interest the uncertain
moods of his betrothed; but with the high-toned
sentiments that distinguished him, refrained from inquiring,
and awaited her voluntary revelations.</p>

<p class='c013'>At last the first of May, the marriage day, upon which
I have presented the parties to the reader, arrived, and all
the <em>haut ton</em>, as I said, were gathered at the Hall or at the
church to do honor to the solemnities.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the expectant bride, in her bridal robe and vail
waited within her boudoir, the arrival of the bridegroom,
whom she had summoned to a private interview before they
should proceed to the church. She had not long to wait.
He who quickly responded to her slightest intimation,
immediately obeyed her call.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet when she heard his firm elastic step approaching,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now God have mercy on me!” she prayed, and covered
her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>He entered, unannounced, and saying,</p>

<p class='c013'>“My beautiful Stella! I am here, you perceive, by your
commands!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She dropped her hands, and revealing a face pale with
misery, spoke in a thrilling, deep, impassioned tone—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are here by my <em>supplication</em>, my lord! I have no
right to command.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We will waive that! what is your will, my dearest
Stella?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My <em>prayer</em>, my lord—is first, for your forgiveness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Forgiveness?</em>—my Stella!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye! my dear lord! you see before you a penitent and a
supplicant, who may soon be something far more wretched!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Stella! what mean you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come to the window, Lord Montressor!” she said, rising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>and preceding him. “Look out,” she continued, putting
aside the rose-colored hangings, and revealing a view
of the park below, alive with its restless multitude. “What
are all these people waiting for, my lord?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are they waiting for, my Stella?—for that, for
which I also wait, with how much more impatience!” he
answered, while a deep flush of love and joy, for an instant,
supplanted the anxiety on his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They wait to see a bride pass, where a bride may never
go!” she said in a solemn voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella! great Heaven! what say you!” he exclaimed,
gazing on her with profound astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That the bride they expect is unworthy to stand before
God’s holy altar beside Lord Montressor!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unworthy, Stella! You!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Most unworthy</em>, my lord!” she said, dropping her arms,
and dropping her head in an attitude of the deepest misery.
“I should have made this confession long ago, Lord Montressor;
but I have deceived you—I have deceived you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In what respect, Stella? My God! It cannot be! No,
it cannot be! that while betrothed to me, you do not love
me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Not love you! Oh! my dear lord!</em>” she murmured, in a
voice of thrilling tenderness that carried conviction of her
truth to his deepest heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What mean you, then, dearest one? if indeed you return
my deep love.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I do, I do, Montressor; whatever happens, wherever
you go, take that assurance with you! I love you, my
lord! shall ever love you, even though after what I shall
have told you, you repulse and hate me, and go to our
friends and say,—‘That woman whom I was about to wed,
is but a whited sepulchre, whom I have proved, and whom I
now reject’—and so leave me to the scorn of men, still I
say—ever shall say—I love you, Lord Montressor! I love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>you, and the consciousness of being unworthy of your love,
is the bitterest element in my punishment,” she said, in a
voice of such profound misery, that Lord Montressor could
scarcely continue to believe her agitation unfounded or
exaggerated.</p>

<p class='c013'>He dropped upon a seat, and sitting still and white as a
carved image of stone, gazed upon her, waiting her further
communications.</p>

<p class='c013'>She had thrown herself into her chair and covered her
face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak, Stella!” at last he said, in kind, encouraging
tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>She dropped her hands from a face from which a deep
blush had burned away the lilies, essayed to obey, but the
words seemed to suffocate her, and she remained silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak, dearest Stella,” once more he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>She cowered and shuddered, murmuring—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! kill me! kill me! Indeed I think it would be
right!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My beloved Stella,” he said, in a voice of deep tenderness,
rising and approaching her—“can you not trust in
me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! not with loving words though! Kill me not with
loving words!” she cried almost wildly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella, be calm, beloved! Your bitter self-accusation
cannot make you seem unworthy to me. Take time and
explain.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor! it was my deep love—alas! the selfish
and injurious sentiment, unworthy the holy name of love,—that
has sealed my lips so long! A hundred times I have
been on the point of making to you a revelation, that I
have never even made to my parents, and as often the
terrible fear that I should never afterward see your face
again, has withheld me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dearest Stella! I know not what you may be about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>to reveal to me; and since it is not that you do not love me,
<em>I</em> do not dread to hear it. I cannot be mistaken in your
pure, womanly heart, Stella; and here I pledge you my
word, that whatever that revelation may be, <em>it shall make
no change in our present relations</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What! Oh, Heaven! What do you say!” exclaimed
Stella, holding her breath in listening.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I say, beloved, that in an hour from this, I shall with
your permission, lead you to the altar; and that whatever
you may in the meanwhile reveal—since it is not that you
have ceased to love me—shall not change my purpose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, what, have I not misunderstood you, my lord?
You did not mean to tell me——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I meant to tell you what I now repeat,—that nothing
you have to reveal shall change our present relations.
Come, dear Stella! if any secret sorrow oppresses your
heart, lay it trustingly on mine. Confide in one, who in
another hour will be your husband.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear Father in Heaven! dost Thou hear him?—dost
Thou hear this man whom I have so long deceived, and
whom I would have so bitterly wronged. Montressor!”
she said in a voice of thrilling tenderness,—“does not the
grief, and terror, and humiliation, written on my brow,
<em>warn</em> you that some deep sin is to be confessed?—something
that may, or must change our present relations, and
make it incumbent on you to go below and announce to our
friends—‘this woman is totally lost, and our marriage is at
an end.’ You are warned. Will you still promise blindly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not blindly, dearest Stella! That something in your
past life has gone very wrong,—that you have hitherto
shrunk from confiding in me, I do begin to see; but that
your sense of honor now obliges you, despite your terrors,
and in the face of all consequences, to make the revelation,
I also see! Stella, I have known and loved you, only you,
for seven years! I am not a man to be mistaken in any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>woman; much less in you, whom I have known and loved
thus long! I love you! esteem you! trust in you! Do
you likewise confide in me! Lay your secret sorrow on
your promised husband’s faithful heart, beloved, for he is
able to shelter and sustain you,” he said, and went and
closed the blinds of the bay-window, to shut out the glaring
sun and the merry laughter, and then returned and sat
down, and held out his arms to receive her, saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, love! come drop your weary head upon my
bosom, and whisper what you have to say.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, Lord Montressor; at your feet, rather, should
your poor Stella tell her story,” she murmured, sinking
down before him, and dropping her face upon her hands;
but he caught and raised her to his heart, and held her
there.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come now, dearest Stella, speak!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas, alas, my lord, you think me a young girl whom
you clasp to your bosom. I am not! What, you do not
put me thence?”</p>

<p class='c013'>He gathered her closer, and bent his head down protectingly
over her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, do you hear me? Do you hear me
say that I am no young girl whom you gather to your
bosom?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A widow, then, my Stella,” he said, changing color, but
modulating his voice so that no slightest inflection should
wound her stricken heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, a widow! Oh, noble <em>Sans peur</em>! And you do
not reproach me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not. Come, now, tell me the whole story, love.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, you know so much of my life that I
need but use a few words to inform you all you require to
be told of its fatal, secret history. You are already aware
that, at the age of seven years, I was sent to Paris, and
placed at Madame L’Orient’s <em>Pensionnat des Demoiselles</em>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>an establishment of the highest reputation, where I remained
until I was fifteen years of age. It was when I had but
just completed my fourteenth year that Victoire L’Orient,
the only son of my teacher, was presented to me by his
mother—” Here the voice of Estelle broke down, and she
paused as if unable to proceed. Her companion waited a
little while, and then said, encouragingly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak freely, dear Stella.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am sure, Lord Montressor, that I do not mean to endeavor
to shift the blame from my own shoulders to those
of others, but at this distance of time I see clearly that
Victoire L’Orient was introduced to me by his mother with
sinister views—to ensnare, in fact, the heart, and win the
hand of the wealthy English heiress. Victoire was ten
years my senior, handsome, accomplished, insinuating, and,
since the truth must be revealed, unprincipled; though of
his moral turpitude I had no suspicion until it was too
late! too late!” Again the voice of Stella sank, and she
covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Compose yourself, dear love, and go on, that this may
be finished, and your heart relieved.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Without seeming to do so, Madame L’Orient fostered
our acquaintance into friendship, if friendship could be said
to exist between the deceiver and the deceived—into intimacy
at least. Looking back now, I cannot understand
the spell of fascination that was woven around me. Enough,
alas, that I thought I loved Victoire, and was drawn step
by step, first into an admission of my sentiments toward
him; then into an engagement, subject to my parent’s consent;
and, finally, without appealing to them, into a clandestine
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Stella ceased and buried her face in her hands. Lord
Montressor laid his hand on her head, and both were silent
for a little while; after which, she resumed, in a voice of
thrilling passion,—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>“Oh, yet think, in judging me, how young I was, how
inexperienced I was, how fatally influenced, in what intriguing
hands, and then how quickly and bitterly I repented.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not <em>judge</em> you, dear one; I only <em>wait</em> to hear the
end.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am sure that while she was careful not to appear in
the matter, Madame L’Orient, who was an accomplished
intriguante, forwarded our marriage. Alas, before many
months, I understood and felt, both how bitterly I had
sinned and had been sinned against. I remained at school
as before my marriage, as it was the decision of my husband
and mother-in-law, who did not wish the reputation of her
establishment to suffer, to keep the union a secret until after
I should have finally left school and returned to England
and my father’s house. My husband, who had lodgings
near the Pensionnat, visited me at his own convenience
rather than at mine. Oh, very soon indeed I discovered
the worthlessness of the man who had ensnared my childish
heart and hand! Would you believe of any man scarcely,
such things as I am about to tell you of him?—not that I
wish to reflect dishonor on the dead, but that I wish you,
Lord Montressor, to know how soon and how terribly I
expiated my sin. Victoire was addicted to inebriation, to
gambling and licentiousness, and every species of dissipation
and excess. These vices kept him always in want of
money; and he not only seized and turned into cash my
girlish trinkets, and appropriated all my pocket-money, but
<em>abused</em> me when I had no more to give him, bidding me
write to my father for funds.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Oh-h!</span>” groaned Lord Montressor, with the energy of
a man who strives hard to repress himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did as he bade me. I drew freely on my father, who
always lectured me severely for my supposed extravagance,
<em>without</em> always honoring my supposed drafts; and when he
did not,” continued Estelle, rising, standing before him, extending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>both her hands, and surveying her own beautiful
figure, “this little form you cherish so tenderly, this slight
frame, that was even smaller then, bore, in black and blue,
the marks of his violence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh-h!” once more groaned Lord Montressor, losing
self-command, starting up, and pacing the floor. Then returning,
he reseated Estelle, stood leaning over her chair,
and asked under his breath:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was the creature left to die a natural death?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Stella shook her head, saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Patience, beloved! God had patience with him, why
should not we? As for myself, my sufferings were a just
retribution. The froward maiden and undutiful daughter
was fitly punished. Young as I was I felt it so, and thus,
with some grace of patience, I accepted it all—all, Montressor!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again, unable to proceed, she paused, and dropped her
face upon her hands, he waiting silently. Presently she
gathered firmness and proceeded:</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a year from my sinful marriage, I became the mother
of an infant girl. My swimming senses scarcely perceived
the child, before all consciousness left me, and life was a
blank for many weeks. When I returned to consciousness,
I found myself at a hotel, in charge of my father and
mother; but my husband and child—where were they?—how
long had I been at the hotel?—and how much of my
circumstances did my parents know? These questions soon
forced themselves upon my mind, ruined my rest by day and
night, and seriously retarded my recovery. I feared my
father even more then than now; and I dared not risk a
single inquiry upon the subjects of my anxiety. At last, I
discovered that I had been ill, though not always unconscious,
for eight weeks; that my parents had been with me
only a few days, and that they were totally unsuspicious of
my new relations as wife and mother. I dared not inform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>them. I waited restlessly, impatiently, for the appearance
of my mother-in-law, who never came. At last, with caution,
I inquired after Madame L’Orient. I was told that
her establishment was broken up, and was recommended to
be still, and refrain from exciting conversation. As I convalesced,
I gradually learned the truth—very gradually, for
had the knowledge come suddenly, I should not now be
here, telling you the story: the terrible shock must have
killed me,” she said, and shuddered from head to foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Compose yourself, and proceed, dear Stella! You
speak to one who sympathizes with every phase of your
suffering.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of my <em>punishment</em>!—that is the proper word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not reproach yourself so severely, Stella; but proceed,
my love.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, how shall I go on! how shall I inform you of the
horrors that came to my knowledge? I should have told
you, that for a week before I was first taken ill, I missed
Victoire, but believing he had gone upon one of his frequent
pleasure excursions, and glad to be left for a few days in
peace, I felt no uneasiness on account of his absence. After
my recovery I learned that at that very time he was under
arrest upon the charge of treason. And during the period
of my long illness he had been tried, convicted, and sentenced
to death. His punishment was afterward commuted
to transportation to the penal colonies. He was then on
his way to Algiers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“His mother, who was seriously implicated in the same
crime, had been examined, and for want of evidence against
her, discharged. Notwithstanding her acquittal, the popular
feeling was so hostile to Madame L’Orient, that she was not
only compelled to break up her establishment, but to leave
the neighborhood. After a great deal of difficulty, I contrived
to secure a private interview with Madame, before
she left the city and inquire the fate of my infant. ‘Dead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>and buried in the Cemetière des Innocens,’ was the answer
I received. She had lived but an hour, and died about the
same time that I had fallen into a state of insensibility.
What more had I to do in Paris, or even in the world. My
life seemed blighted, my heart broken, my doom sealed at
fifteen years of age. My injured and unsuspicious parents,
concerned for their daughter’s failing health and spirits,
took me to the German baths, thence to Sicily, thence over
Europe, and finally brought me home to England, in the
faint hope that quietness and native air might do for me
that which travel and change of scene had failed to do. In
vain! there was no hope, or help for me in this world. My
sorrow was deepened by the necessity of concealing its
dreadful cause. I dared not confide that secret passage of
my life to either of my parents. You know the uncompromising
arrogance of Sir Parke, and the sensitive delicacy
of Lady Morelle. Their only and cherished daughter the
wife of a ——! The revelation would have killed my
mother, would have driven my father mad! I bore my sorrow—my
punishment in silence; but do you wonder at my
deep, incurable melancholy? As a last resort, they took
me up to London, presented me at Court, and introduced
me into the whirl of fashionable life. My debut in society
made what is called ‘a sensation,’—my career was, in common
parlance, ‘successful.’ I had many ‘eligible’ suitors;
perhaps the sadness that shrunk from observation and attention,
was from its very strangeness attractive. At length
you came, and saw and loved me, all unworthy as I was,
and I soon perceived in you the master of my heart and
life! But, oh! the unspeakable agony of feeling this, and
feeling too, that I never, never, never could be yours! So,
at the last day, feels the sinner who sees, at length, that for
some fair poisonous apple of Sodom, unlawfully seized on
earth, he has lost the kingdom of Heaven! <em>Do you still
wonder at my deep, incurable melancholy?</em> We parted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>I bore that sharp anguish, as I had borne all the rest, even
as the just retribution of my sin!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear, dear Stella! you reproach yourself without
measure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I recovered from the long, nervous fever into
which that great trial had thrown me—to please my parents
I re-entered society, and was followed, flattered, courted as
before; but nothing would dissipate the gloom of my soul.
At last, while in Berkely square, at my father’s breakfast table,
I heard him read from the Daily Times, among other
items of news, the account of the wreck of the French ship
‘<em>Le Duc D’Anjou</em>,’ on her passage from Algiers. Now
the slightest circumstance relating to that Province had for
me a terrible interest, and I listened as I should never have
done had not the ship sailed from that coast. The last
name on the list of the lost was that of Victoire L’Orient!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“God forgive me! I thought not of the horrors of the
shipwreck, the sufferings of the crew, or even of the loss of
the poor men drowned with Victoire. I only felt my evil
genius gone, the gloom and terror lifted from my life, and
I swooned with the shock of a great deliverance!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not wonder, good Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the reaction came, I knew how wrong had been
this feeling; and to atone for it, and to pay respect to <em>death</em>,
if not to the <em>dead</em>, I withdrew from society and retired to
this place, where I remained in seclusion eighteen months,
just as I should have done in mourning the decease of a
near and honored relative. I brought down that copy of
the Times, containing the account of the shipwreck, and
have preserved it—here it is,” she said, lifting an old paper
from a table near her. “Look at it—there is a note in
parenthesis following the name of Victoire L’Orient—I
mention it only as a providential confirmation of the identity
of the man.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Lord Montressor opened the paper, looked down the
column until he came to the list of the lost, and to the last
name—Victoire L’Orient, with the following annotation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This man, it may be remembered, was some years since
convicted of a complicity in the treason of De Vil, attended
with circumstances of a memorable character, and was sentenced
to be transported for life to the convict colony of
Algiers. He had lately received his pardon, and was on
his way to France.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why have you preserved this, Stella?” inquired Lord
Montressor, when he had finished reading.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not know—some strange instinct!—perhaps to
prevent my fancying the account to be a mere dream. Well!
at the end of my eighteen months of self-inflicted seclusion,
I summoned you, dearest friend, to my side. You came,
loyal heart! you came at once! I meant to have immediately
revealed to you the secret story of my sin and punishment,
and so, before you should have had time to commit
yourself, left my fate in your hands. But that first interview
was so sweet that I could not disturb its harmony! I
said, ‘I will tell him to-morrow.’ Morning came, and we
were so happy, I shrank from clouding our bright joy; I
said, ‘I will tell him in the evening.’ Your very perfections
frightened me from the task. Again and again I postponed
the revelation, in the vain hope that another day I should
have more courage to make it. Alas! day by day, the disclosure
grew to seem more strange and difficult. At length
as the day of our marriage drew near, each hour rendered
the necessity of my confession more imminent, and the act
of making it more terrible! Last Sunday I thought I
would then tell you; but—I <em>could</em> not do it! Yesterday
I felt sure that I should inform you; but, the first attempted
words suffocated me! The scene around swam before
me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas! did you so dread me, my gentle Stella?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“This morning <em>all</em> dreads vanished before one great
fear!—the fear of presently standing before the Lord’s holy
altar, to palm upon you as a maiden’s hand, the hand of the
widow of Victoire L’Orient. This is my revelation, Lord
Montressor,” she said, rising with a certain mournful dignity.
“I sinned first and greatly, against my parents in
contracting a secret and unauthorized marriage; and long
and terribly have I expiated it! But I have sinned even
more against your pure, noble nature, in keeping this from
your knowledge since our engagement, and even up to this
last hour! It has cost me much to make it now; but now,
that all is said, I feel relieved and strengthened! You are
my judge, Lord Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dearest Stella,” he said, taking her hand, reseating her,
and standing, leaning over her chair, “let me be now, as
always, perfectly frank with you. First, let me repeat that
your painful story has made no difference in my feelings and
purposes toward you, nor, as a matter of course, in our
present and future relations. I do not gainsay, dear Stella,
that your premature marriage was a great wrong; but I
remember that you were an inexperienced child in the hands
of intriguing and insinuating people, with whom you were
not prepared to cope! I do not either deny that your concealment
of your previous marriage, first from your parents,
and afterward from your affianced husband, was a greater
wrong; but I can easily understand how, in the first case,
the haughty severity of Sir Parke, and the sensitive pride
of Lady Morelle, should alike have frightened you from
making the revelation; and still better can I sympathize
with your shrinking reluctance to confide such a secret to
me; and feel how much more difficult every day of delay
must have rendered such a confession; and through all, how
your refined and sensitive mind, brooding day and night
over your misfortune, should have come to exaggerate both
the magnitude of the fault and the difficulty of concealing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>it; and, finally, my victorious Stella, I can appreciate the
triumph of principle in your present disclosure. Come to
my heart, sweet Stella!” he said, opening his arms and
gathering her to his bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not until this hour, dear Stella, have I fully won your
heart,” he whispered, dropping his face caressingly upon the
silky black ringlets of her bowed head—“not until this hour
have I fully won your heart!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But now I am all your own. Oh, my lord! my lord!—all
your own—heart, soul, and spirit!” she said, in a voice
of thrilling tenderness. “I had that blighting secret, that
I dared not lay on the strong breast of the father that gave
me life, nor on the tender bosom of the mother that bore
me, but which at last I confide to your own great heart, and
you receive the trust, and gather me within the fold of your
powerful arms, and have no word of bitter reproach for my
sin, but only a tender compassion for my sufferings; no
humbling pity for my weakness, but only a noble sympathy
with my struggles, and praise for my late—too late victory!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reproach for <em>you</em>, my wounded dove? my gentle, patient
sufferer? Nay, rest on my bosom; rest sweetly here awhile,”
he murmured, smoothing her hair with his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, the blessed relief, the sweet, sweet repose, the
measureless content, I find on this sustaining breast!” she
breathed, in a deep sigh of deliverance and rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would for your own sake, beloved, that you had sooner
laid the burden of your secret sorrow upon your promised
husband’s faithful heart—that you might have sooner found
the relief he can give you, gentle and beautiful Stella.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beautiful! did you say, my lord? Would, indeed, that
I were infinitely beautiful, that I possessed genius and accomplishments
equal to that beauty, and wealth and power
to match both, for your sake, Montressor; for I should say
then as now,—‘all that I am and all that I have belong less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>to me than to my dear and honored lord! I am his own,
his own! I am cradled in his heart! I live, breathe, think,
love only in and from his great life.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are, indeed, sweet Stella, the heart of my heart!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would your Stella were more worthy of you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“More worthy of me? Do not talk so, love! Women
are queens, always too good, for men; and you of women,
most queenly, and should not bate your state, to speak to
your subject in this style,” said Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Woman should not reveal her heart so plainly even to
him who possesses it! Is that your meaning, my lord, and
is it so?—for I, you see, do not know! I only know intimately
one woman—myself, and now I am not so much
myself as you? Shall I practice reserve with <em>you</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, dearest; too long you have practiced reserve.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, that is over. I have laid my soul open to your
view! I have shown you a sorrow that I dared not trust
to father or mother; even as we let the holy eye of God see
things which we conceal from our dearest friends.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But now your parents must be informed of all, dear
Stella.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! no, no, no! It would kill the one and craze the
other,” exclaimed Estelle, white with terror. “No, no;
none but your own kindly heart could bear the revelation!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fear nothing, dear Stella. They need not be told just
yet; with their feelings, the disclosure of such a story concerning
their daughter, Miss Morelle, might indeed be
attended with serious consequences. I shall wait until the
law has invested me with the exclusive right to watch over
your honor, peace and welfare, and to protect you, if need
be, even against the severity of your father, and the reproaches
of your mother, before I make the disclosure, and
then, the story told them of Lady Montressor by the lips
of her husband, who here pledges himself to bear her blameless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and harmless through all—will come very much softened
to their ears.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Heaven! Lord Montressor, will you do this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It must be done, beloved! Your parents must know
all; your life must be cleared and calmed. I take that task
upon myself. Resign yourself to my charge; trust in me;
lay your weary, young head on my breast, and let your
spirit sleep if you will; for no harm can come to you in the
shelter of my love!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! you are so good and great! Would I were better
and wiser for your sake! You should have an angel for a
wife!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor smiled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not aspire to an angel, or to any better or happier
woman. I love you just so, with the mournful earth beauty
in your eyes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The opening of the door startled them, and Lady Morelle
entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was a magnificent-looking woman—of a tall and
finely-proportioned figure, and a haughty carriage, delicate
aquiline features, with an expression of blended pride and
fastidiousness, fair complexion, blue eyes, and light hair
arranged in plain bandeaux. She wore a light blue brocade
satin dress, and a mantilla of rich white lace. She
entered, smiling proudly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor rose to greet her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, my lord, I hope the interview this most
capricious of dear Stellas demanded, is at an end, for,
whether it be or not, I must interrupt you. It is half-past
eleven, and if there is a marriage to be solemnized to-day,
it is full time we were at the church.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our interview is concluded, madam! I am ready, and
only waiting your ladyship’s convenience,” said Lord
Montressor advancing an easy chair for the lady’s reception.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“Thank you, I do not wish to rest. Your attendants,
my lord, are——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They are probably now waiting for me at the church, madam,
where I will meet you a few minutes hence. <em>Au
revoir</em>, dear Stella!” said his lordship, and lifting the hand
of his promised bride to his lips, and then bowing to Lady
Morelle, he left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady rang for her daughter’s maid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I declare, Estelle, I never knew so strange a girl!
Now what, possibly, could you have wanted to say to Montressor
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I only wanted to put his heart to a last trial, dear
mamma.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your head is turned, I think!—but here comes Finette.
Now stand up and have your robe smoothed, and your
wreath and vail put on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment the French dressing-maid, Finette, entered,
and Estelle stood up before the cheval mirror, while
the girl drew down the folds of her robe, and took up the
virginal wreath of orange blossoms to set upon her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not that—not that, Finette! Open that box, it contains
a coronet I have chosen for this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The girl raised the lid of the box that her mistress had
indicated, and drew thence a rich wreath of passion
flowers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is the wreath I shall wear, Finette.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, my dearest Estelle, how eccentric! Who ever
heard of a bride wearing other than orange blossoms in her
hair? Do, love, be reasonable!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do, sweet mamma, indulge me on my marriage day
and permit me even to be <em>un</em>reasonable in the trifling affair
of choosing a wreath.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well, as you please, you dear, eccentric creature!
Lady Montressor will soon be in a position to give the law
to fashion in all matters of taste, and it is easy to foresee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>that she will be an innovator!” said Lady Morelle, proudly
and fondly, as she gazed upon her beautiful daughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus the wreath of passion flowers was placed upon
her brow, the vail thrown over her head, and the toilet of
the bride was complete.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come now, my love, let us go down,” said the lady, giving
her arm to her daughter to conduct her from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>In five more minutes Estelle Morelle was handed into a
close carriage, the three other seats of which were occupied
by her father, mother, and first bridesmaid. This carriage
was preceded by that of the Duchess of Graveminster, and
that of Lord Dazzleright, and was followed by a barouche
containing the four other bridesmaids, and by various
coaches of the friends, relatives and acquaintances, of the
bride’s family, who had been invited to attend her to the
church. As the procession defiled down the grand avenue,
the village men and maidens gathered on either side to see
it pass, and children threw flowers in the road. The bell
rung a joyous peal, that continued until the cortege reached
the church, which was a small gothic building just beyond
the Park gates. The yard was filled with carriages of almost
every description, and among them was recognized the
crimson and grey liveries of Lord Montressor. As the
cortege entered the church-yard, Lord Montressor alighted,
and stood waiting until the carriage of Sir Parke Morelle,
drew up before the church door, when he went and received
his bride as she descended, and bowing with reverential
tenderness, drew her arm within his own, and preceded by
the Duchess of Graveminster on the arm of Sir Parke Morelle,
and then by Lady Morelle on that of Lord Dazzleright,
and followed by the bridesmaids and groomsmen in
pairs, entered the church. The pews and the side aisles
were crowded to suffocation; and the beadle had enough to
do to keep the centre aisle sufficiently clear to admit the
passage of the bridal procession.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Amid all this assembly, one group, gathered into a remote
and deeply shaded pew in the corner to the extreme
left of the entrance, in their manifest desire to avoid observation,
might, at any other time, have attracted notice.
But now all eyes were fixed upon the entree of the procession.
This group consisted of a middle-aged, dark-complexioned,
mercurial little woman of foreign aspect, clothed
in black; a young man, with a tall and well-proportioned
figure, regular features, deeply-bronzed complexion and jet
black hair and eyes, of somewhat sinister expression; an
elderly, dignified, magisterial-looking gentleman, and
lastly—of a policeman who seemed to be retained in the
service of the party.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the bridal train entered the church, the little swarthy
woman quickly averted her head and let down her thick
black vail, and the young man stooped out of sight, as if
to pick up something from the floor. The magisterial-looking
individual put on his spectacles, and regarded the train
with an ambiguous half-smile; while the police-officer
looked on with unconcealed curiosity. When they had
passed the pew, the little restless foreign woman plucked
at the sleeve of the young man and pointing to the procession
now approaching the altar, exclaimed quickly, under
her breath,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look you, Victoire! Can you bear this, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No matter, Madame! I wait!” said the Frenchman
with a wicked smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you not stop this, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no Madame! I wait!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For why, you wait?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For that she <em>des</em>pise, she <em>ab</em>hor, she scorn me—the
convict! Very well!—I make her to be also convict herself!”
hissed the man between his closed teeth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the bridal train proceeded up the aisle and
formed before the altar in something like the following order—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>old Duchess of Graveminster and Sir Parke Morelle,
leading the way, filed off to the extreme right; Lady
Morelle and Lord Dazzleright, following, passed off to the
left; next came the bride and bridegroom who took their
places in the centre; then their attendants, coming up in
pairs, divided and formed on either side—the bridesmaids
filling up the segment of the semicircle between the bride and
her mother, and the groomsmen occupying the corresponding
space between the bridegroom and his father-in-law.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun shining in rich, deep-toned glory through the
gorgeously stained glass Gothic windows on either side the
high altar, never fell upon a more imposing bridal circle.
There was the bridegroom, with his tall, well set, kingly
form, and most noble head and face, full of conscious
power, and wisdom, and protective love; and the bride
with her dark, bright, wondrous beauty and her matchless
grace; and the stately bridemen and the fair bridemaidens.—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Each a queen by virtue of her breast and brow;”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>and there were the dignified Sir Parke, the regal Lord Morelle,
the haughty old Duchess of Graveminster and the
splendid Lord Dazzleright. And there within the altar
rails before the aisle stood the venerable Bishop of Exeter,
between two assistant clergymen. And all—congregation,
companions, and officiating ministers, were regarding with
looks of admiration, affection, or pride, the presence of the
beautiful bride.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Bishop opened the book. And every whisper was
hushed, and every eye reverently dropped as the venerable
prelate, in a solemn voice, pronounced the first words of the
imposing ritual.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dearly beloved, we are gathered together, here in the
sight of God, and in the face of this company, to join together
this man and this woman, in holy matrimony; which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>is commended of St. Paul to be honorable among all men;
and therefore is not to be entered into unadvisedly, or
lightly; but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly and in
the fear of God. Into this holy state these two people
present come now to be joined.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If any man can show just cause, why they may not lawfully
be joined together, let him now speak, or else hereafter
forever, hold his peace.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Bishop now made the usual solemn pause, during
which not a breath seemed drawn in the silent church.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though had any one been sufficiently near that ill-omened
group in the shadowy corner pew, they might have caught
the deep, hurried whisper of the woman—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Attend you, Victoire!—listen, then, my son!” And
the hissing reply of the man—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madame!—but mon Dieu! I wait!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the rites proceeded—the grave voice of the
prelate was pronouncing the question—</p>

<p class='c013'>“George Charles, wilt thou have this woman to be thy
wedded wife, to live together after God’s ordinance, in the
holy estate of matrimony? Wilt thou love her, comfort
her, honor and keep her in sickness and in health; and forsaking
all others keep thee only unto her as long as ye both
shall live?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Bishop paused.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the bridegroom, fixing his eyes in unutterable love
upon the downcast, beautiful face of his bride, in a deep,
proud, tender voice responded—“I will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the same question being put to her, she lifted her
large eyes for an instant to his, and a glow of ineffable devotion
suffused her beautiful, dark face as she too breathed
the same vow.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the next question—“Who giveth this woman to be
married to this man?”—Sir Parke Morelle stepped forward,
took the hand of his daughter and placed it in that of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Bishop who transferred it to the hand of the bridegroom
Lord Montressor received the cherished gift reverently, tenderly,
with a deep inclination of his noble head, and a thrilling
pressure of his clasping hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then followed the putting on of the ring, and then the
prayers, the valedictory, and finally the nuptial benediction.</p>

<p class='c013'>The imposing solemnities were over.</p>

<p class='c013'>And friends gathered around with blessings; and then
came in turn, the grave, earnest, tender, gay or gallant forms
of congratulations—as the officiating ministers, the father,
mother, bridemaids and bridemen pressed around with many
kind wishes.</p>

<p class='c013'>This occasioned some considerable delay, in the midst of
which the ominous party in the dark corner pew might have
been observed to steal out and retire from the church.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Enough! enough!” at length smilingly said Sir Parke,
sympathizing with the blushing embarrassment of the recipient
of all these compliments, and taking her hand and
placing it upon the arm of Lord Montressor, who drew it
closely to his side, bowed around to his friends, and turned
to lead his bride from the church—a performance more
easily to be wished than accomplished; for the people were
now pressing out of the pews, and the aisles were choked
up with the crowd. Thus their progress from the altar to
the door was an alternate step and pause—a sort of stop-march.
And thus a delay of more than half an hour intervened
between the moment of their receiving the nuptial
benediction and that of their issuing from the church door.
As the church, the yard was crowded with people of all
classes, eager to see the bride pass.</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole party, including the officiating Bishop and
clergymen, were expected to return to Hyde Hall to partake
of the wedding breakfast; after which, Lord and Lady Montressor
were to set out for his lordship’s castle in Dorsetshire,
where they intended to pass the honeymoon.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>The church-yard was so crowded that it was with great
difficulty and after much hindrance that Lord Montressor’s
carriage could be driven up. And with his shrinking bride
upon his arm, and her friends around, he waited before the
church door, until it drew up, and one of the footmen
alighted, let down the steps and opened the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship then bowed to his friends, and was about to
hand his lady into the carriage, when a policeman, pressing
through the crowd, placed himself between the carriage door
and the bridal pair, intercepting their further passage, while
he respectfully inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which of these ladies, here present, bears the name of
Estelle L’Orient?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>No</em> lady here bears that name; stand out of the way,
sir,” said Lord Montressor, haughtily, while Estelle, with a
half-suppressed cry, lowered her vail and leaned heavily upon
his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us pass, sir!” repeated his lordship, sternly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon me, my lord, if in the discharge of my duty I
cannot obey your lordship,” answered the officer, who, in
manners and address seemed much superior to his class.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What mean you, then, sir?” gravely inquired Lord
Montressor, while Estelle hid her face in the folds of her
vail against his arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, I have a warrant here for the arrest of one
Estelle L’Orient, and if I mistake not, this is the lady,” said
the officer, indicating the bride by a respectful inclination
of his head toward her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! Mon Dieu, that is the woman!” exclaimed a
shrill voice, coming from the little old dark and shriveled
Frenchwoman, who stood at a short distance in the crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh! Mon Dieu, yes!—that is <em>my</em> woman!—that is <em>my</em>
bride!—that is the wife of the felon!” exclaimed the vindictive
looking Frenchman by her side, gesticulating the
while like a madman.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>A crowd of astonished faces now pressed closely upon the
group, around the carriage door, before which stood the
policeman. And through this crowd, as one having authority,
now came Park Morelle, inquiring in haughty displeasure—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the meaning of this delay? Good people, give
way! My lord, in the name of Heaven put Lady Montressor
into the carriage, and drive on! Let us get out of this!
Why Montressor! Estelle! what the fiend is the meaning
of all this?” exclaimed the baronet, perceiving now for the
first time by the pale, corrugated brow of the bridegroom,
the shuddering form and hidden face of the bride, the resolute
bearing of the policeman, and the horrified looks of the
people, that something—he guessed not what—was fearfully
wrong.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the meaning of all this? Montressor, why do
you not speak?” he asked, in an agitated voice—when,
turning haughtily upon the police-officer, he demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is <em>your</em> business here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me, Sir Parke Morelle, I am here on duty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>What</em> duty, fellow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am charged with a warrant for the apprehension of
one Estelle L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Whom?</span>” frowningly demanded the baronet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One Estelle L’Orient—this lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Out of the way, fellow! You are drunk, and richly
deserve to be sent to prison. There is no such person here.
Out of the way, I say, or I shall give you in charge!” exclaimed
the baronet, losing all patience.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon me, Sir Parke, but I must execute my warrant,”
persisted the man; then stepping forward, and laying his
hand upon the shoulder of the bride, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle L’Orient, I arrest you in the king’s name; you
are my prisoner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Sirrah!</em>” thundered Sir Parke, striding forward and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>striking off from his daughter’s shoulder the desecrating
hand of the policeman: “Are you frantic?—have you the
least idea of what sacrilege means?—do you know what
you are about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly well, Sir Park Morelle. I am about to take
this lady into custody,” said the officer, approaching his
prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begone, fellow, or by Heaven! mad or drunk, you shall
dearly rue your mistake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Sir Parke Morelle mistakes</em>; but he will not resist his
majesty’s warrant,” said the man, drawing the instrument
from his pocket; and, while the crowd pressed closer
around in amazement and wonder, Sir Parke stood the picture
of incredulous astonishment and rage; and Lord
Montressor, with corrugated brow and compressed lips,
continued to support the form of Estelle, who now stood
with clasped hands, white face, and stony eyes, gazing upon
the figure of the Frenchman as upon that of a phantom
raised from the dead—the policeman unfolded and read the
warrant.</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='sc'>County of Devon.</span>—To the Constable of Hyde and all
other peace-officers in the said county of Devon:</p>

<p class='c016'>Forasmuch as Gabrielle L’Orient, widow, now in this
said county, hath this day made information and complaint
upon oath before me, George Bannerman, one of his majesty’s
justices of the peace in and for the said county, that
Estelle L’Orient, of the said county, on this Thursday of
the first instant, at the parish church of the parish of
Hyde, feloniously intermarried with George Charles, Lord
Viscount Montressor, in and during the life of her husband,
Victoire L’Orient, now living in these realms—these are,
therefore, to command you, in his majesty’s name forthwith
to apprehend and bring before me, or some other of his
majesty’s justices of the peace in and of the said county,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>the body of the said Estelle L’Orient, to answer unto the
said complaint, and to be further dealt with according to
law. Herein fail you not at your peril. Given under my
hand and seal, this first day of May, in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred and ——.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The officer finished the reading, folded the document, returned
it to his breast-coat pocket, and stood for a while
waiting. No one, who had not seen, could imagine the
consternation that held the assembled crowd in a trance of
breathless silence. Sir Parke Morelle was the first to
break the fearful spell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Madam!</span>” he said, striding up and confronting his
wretched daughter, whose conscious looks were the most
alarming features in the case, “why do you not speak? If
this is a conspiracy, expose it. Where is the wretch that
has made this complaint?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, my lord! Behold me! I am that wretch. I
depose—I witness, that Madam Estelle L’Orient is the
wife of my son, Monsieur Victoire L’Orient,” exclaimed the
wicked-looking little French woman, whom Sir Parke now
saw and recognized as the quondam governess of his
daughter. Beginning to perceive the truth, the baronet
turned upon his child and inquired, in a tone of suppressed
fury—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Madam</span>, answer! What foundation is there for this
trumped-up story?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>It is true</em>,” said the wretched Estelle, letting her arms
fall by her side, and her chin drop upon her breast, with a
look of utter despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do your duty, officer. Remove your prisoner. Take
the <em>feloness</em> quickly out of my sight!” cried the baronet,
nearly maddened by the shock that had so suddenly hurled
his towering pride to the dust.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“Sir Parke! Sir Parke! in mercy, you will not abandon
your child in her extremity,” pleaded Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By all the demons, sir, she is no child of mine! I renounce
the wife of Monsieur Victoire L’Orient,” cried the
baronet striding away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Parke, for the love of God, <em>look on her</em>!” prayed
Lord Montressor, laying his hand on the arm of the enraged
father, and seeking to detain him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Release me, sir,” thundered the baronet, breaking from
his clasp; “My carriage there, sirrahs! Where is Lady
Morelle? Let her ladyship be summoned.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Morelle has fainted, and has been conveyed into
the church, my lord,” said the Duchess of Graveminster,
who had remained standing in an attitude of stern and
solemn haughtiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke left orders for his carriage to come up, and
then strode off in the direction of the church.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor sought to reassure the deserted and
despairing woman at his side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, dear, suffering one, take comfort; all that a
Christian man may do for you, in your extremity, shall be
done by me; rely on me; I will never fail you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monsieur, the constable, look at that woman! She has
no right to be on the arm of my lord. Do your duty!
arrest her!” exclaimed the Frenchman, with vindictive haste.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I fear I must not long delay, my lord,” interrupted the
policeman, respectfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One moment, officer, if you please. Madam, for the
love of the Saviour, sustain this poor, stricken one, until I
send a clergyman to attend her. Estelle, dearest, I must,
for your own sake, leave you now. I go to send you proper
aid. I will see you again at the magistrate’s—until
then, farewell,” said Lord Montressor, gently withdrawing
his sustaining arm, and laying her upon the half-repellant,
haughty bosom of the Duchess of Graveminster.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>“God forever bless you, my lord. Whatever becomes
of poor Estelle, may God forever love and bless you!”
murmured the poor girl, waving him adieu.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor hastened into the church and into the
vestry, where the Bishop and assistant clergymen were taking
off their robes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, <em>what</em> has happened?” exclaimed the venerable
prelate, almost appalled by the pale and haggard
countenance and hurried and anxious manner of his lordship;
while the two assistant clergymen approached and
<em>looked</em> the wonder they forbore to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor hastily and briefly related all that had
passed; together with the history of the wretched marriage
into which Estelle, while a child at school, had been
inveigled by the designing governess and her unprincipled
son, with the account of the crime, trial, conviction, and
transportation of Victoire, the long separation, and the
final published report of his loss in the wreck of ‘<em>Le Duc
D’Anjou</em>,’ three years since.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The warrant for her arrest was issued by Sir George
Bannerman, a bitter enemy of her father. He must have
taken the deposition and issued the warrant immediately
after the marriage ceremony was concluded. He must have
been on the premises for that purpose; for I saw his carriage
leaving the church,” said his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw Sir George himself <em>in</em> the church,” said the Reverend
Mr. Oldfield, the elder of the two clergymen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>In</em> the church! then he witnessed the marriage, heard
the solemn adjuration at its commencement, might have
spoken, stopped the proceedings, and saved this most unhappy
of ladies from her present misfortunes! Any but a
malignant enemy would have interfered to save her! The
case will probably go to trial and come up at the next
assizes; but there I am sure an action cannot be successfully
sustained against her. And if the course of this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>magistrate has been as I suspect, that fact will be a powerful
weapon in the hands of her counsel; and will also go far
to hurl Sir George Bannerman himself, from his seat on the
bench. Meanwhile, however, the father of Estelle has
abandoned her to her fate. I, unhappily, through my late
relations to her, am disabled from directly protecting her,
my known intervention would be far more likely to injure
than to benefit her cause; but you, reverened sirs,” continued
his lordship, turning toward the two assistant
clergymen, “you, Mr. Oldfield and Mr. Trevor, are friends
of her family. Your age, holy calling, and position, all
constitute the most proper and desirable persons to stand
in the relation of protectors to this most unfortunate lady.
Go with her to the magistrate’s—will you not, sirs?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The two ministers spoke together for an instant, and then
Mr. Oldfield answered for both—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Most willingly will we attend the lady, my lord; but
had we not best object to a hearing before Sir George Bannerman,
and demand that she be taken before some other
and impartial justice of the peace?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Upon the whole, <em>no</em> sir; it will make little difference, in
the end, and I think it best that this man should be allowed
to show his hand,” said Lord Montressor; then tearing a
leaf from a blank book on the table, writing a check for a
thousand pounds on the bank of Exeter, and handing it to
Mr. Oldfield, he continued, “Offer bail to any amount for
her appearance at court; and then, Mr. Oldfield, I am sure
that you will take this poor, shorn lamb to your fold, put
her under the care of your excellent lady, and bid her trust
God with the result.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We will certainly do all that can possibly be done for
this poor child in her extremity; but—put up your check,
my dear lord, for though you are her truest friend, it is not
expedient that this good office should emanate from you,”
said the venerable man.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“I believe you are right, sir; but what then can be done,
since her father abandons her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again the two clergymen conversed apart, and then Mr.
Trevor spoke—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are not bankers, my lord, it is true; but we can
afford to risk some hundred pounds apiece.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Risk, sir! There will be no risk—do you know Estelle,
and imagine that she will not duly present herself for
trial?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly not—certainly not, my dear lord! The word
was unhappily chosen. I meant merely that we might be
held <em>responsible</em> for so much money.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go now, dear sirs, to that poor girl, lest the Duchess
of Graveminster think her ermine irremediably tarnished by
holding any longer that blighted head upon her bosom. I
will meet you at the magistrate’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Use my carriage, if no other is provided, Oldfield; I
will find a seat in Lord Montressor’s, and be in attendance
also,” said the kind-hearted bishop, whose sympathies had
been strongly moved. The reverened gentleman thanked
the bishop, and left the church in search of their unhappy
charge. On reaching the yard they found that every carriage,
with the exception of that of Lord Montressor and
that of the Bishop of Exeter, had left the scene. Yes—parents,
friends, acquaintances, bridemaids and bridemen,
all had fled the place as though the plague were there.
The Duchess of Graveminster had departed with the rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle was left unsustained, leaning for support against
the upright headstone of an humble grave, and guarded by
the policeman.</p>

<p class='c013'>The pitying clergyman approached her, laid his hand
upon her bowed head, and gently said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be not so utterly cast down, my child; raise your heart
to Him who—when ‘all forsook him and fled,’ remained unshaken
in his trust of his Father.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>But the grief-stunned girl seemed not to hear, or see, or
be in any way conscious of the presence of the speaker; she
remained wrapped in her white robe and vail, leaning over
the tombstone, perfectly motionless, and might have
seemed some risen ghost or descended spirit standing at
the grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, come, my child, look up, give me your hand, let
me put you into the carriage; there are some necessary
forms to be gone through, and then you are free; and you
are to go home with me to Bloomingdale parsonage, for a
visit, until your father feels better and comes for you, as he
will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But still she neither moved, nor spoke, and might have
seemed less a woman, or a spirit, than some draped marble
statue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, my lamb, come,” pursued Mr. Oldfield, taking
her cold and passive hand, drawing it within his arm, and
leading her away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very docilely she suffered herself to be placed in the carriage,
when Mr. Oldfield entered and took the seat beside
her, and Mr. Trevor followed, and placed himself on the
front cushion. The policeman mounted the box beside the
coachman, and the carriage was driven off. Almost immediately
after, the Bishop on Exeter and Lord Montressor
entered the carriage of the latter, and followed on the same
road.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>A rapid drive of an hour’s length, brought the party to
Horsford, the seat of Sir George Bannerman, knight, the
magistrate who had issued the warrant.</p>

<p class='c013'>A winding avenue led from the highway to the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>On arriving before the main entrance, the foremost carriage
drove up, and the footman sprang down from behind,
opened the door and let down the steps, while the policeman
got off the box and stood guard.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield alighted first, and handed out Estelle, who,
pale as death, with her face still wrapped in her bridal vail,
mechanically permitted herself to be conducted by her aged
friend up the broad marble stairs leading into the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were preceded by the policeman, who knocked at
the door, which was opened by a footman in attendance;
while just within, the fat, gouty-looking porter, sat indolently
in his arm-chair, with gold spectacles on his nose,
reading the “Times.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The policeman telegraphed to this dignitary, who, without
leaving his seat, or raising his eyes from his paper,
answered—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>“In the library. Here, John, show this party up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The footman who had admitted them, now came forward,
indicated his forehead with his forefinger, by way of obeisance
to the lady and the clergymen, beckoned the officer,
and led the way up the broad oaken stairs to a long gallery
above, at the extreme end of which was the door of the
library, where the preliminary examination was to be conducted.
Opening this door, the man announced—</p>

<p class='c013'>“P’lice an’ pris’ners y’ honor,” admitted them, closed the
door, and retired.</p>

<p class='c013'>The party found themselves in a rich, antique, and handsomely-furnished
library, the walls of which were alternately
lighted with stained glass gothic windows, and lined
with richly wrought and well-filled book-cases.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the upper extremity of this room, behind a long
table, covered with a green cloth, sat Sir George Bannerman;
on his right hand was his secretary, and near the end
of the table, on the same side, were gathered Madame
L’Orient, Monsieur Victoire, and a little French Abbe.
Near the magistrate stood Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the venerable clergyman advanced, supporting his
fragile charge, Sir George arose, gravely acknowledged
their presence by a slight bow, and sat down again.</p>

<p class='c013'>The officer preceding the party, laid his warrant before
the magistrate, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here is the prisoner, your worship,” bowed, and retired
a step or two.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir George took up the document, and while he was
looking over it in silence, the library door was once more
opened, and—</p>

<p class='c013'>“His lordship, the Bishop of Exeter, and Lord Montressor,
to attend the examination,” were announced.</p>

<p class='c013'>They entered gravely, bowed in silence to Sir George
Bannerman, who acknowledged their salutation by a momentary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>lifting of his eyes and a nod, and then took their
stand upon the side near Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was this <em>well</em> done, Sir George Bannerman?” vehemently
inquired Mr. Oldfield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To what do you allude, sir?” asked the knight, without
lifting his glance from the document in his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I allude to the arrest of the lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reverend sir, one of your excellent judgment should
know that the <em>law</em>, no more than the <em>gospel</em>, is a ‘respecter
of persons.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not, Sir George! but you were in the church
at the time this illegal marriage took place; you heard the
solemn adjuration of the Lord Bishop officiating, that—if
any man there present knew cause why the contracting
parties should not be joined in matrimony, he should then
and there declare it. Sir, you sat there, with this unhappy
lady’s husband by your side, and heard this solemn adjuration,
and you did not speak! But speedily after the accomplishment
of the act, you issued the warrant for the lady’s
arrest. Sir George Bannerman, I ask you once more, <em>was</em>
this act, on the part of a Christian, a gentleman, and a
magistrate, <em>well done</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir, a distinguished professor of the orthodox principles
of human free agency like yourself, should understand
that the <em>law</em>, no more than the <em>gospel</em>, interferes arbitrarily
to prevent crime; that it can only judge and punish; but
sir, we lose time; will you have the kindness to stand aside
and let me see the prisoner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a deep-drawn sigh, bearing to Heaven an earnest
prayer for the despairing one at his side, the good clergyman
withdrew a step, and Estelle was left standing unsupported
before the green table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, will you be kind enough to unvail?” said the
magistrate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle turned aside her vail, revealing a face so deathly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>in its hue that they who beheld it suddenly blanched in
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your name, Madam, is Estelle L’Orient?”</p>

<p class='c013'>She bowed assent.</p>

<p class='c013'>The magistrate then took up the warrant for her arrest,
read it aloud to her, replaced it on the table, and addressing
her, said,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle L’Orient, you are herein charged, under oath,
by Madame Gabrielle L’Orient, here present, with having
this day, at the parish church of Hyde, in and during the
life of your husband, Victoire L’Orient, now living in these
realms, feloniously intermarried with George Charles, Viscount
Montressor, said marriage constituting an act of
bigamy, against the peace and dignity of the king’s majesty,
and punishable by transportation, according to the statute
in such case made and provided. What have you to say
to this charge?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing here, sir;—much perhaps hereafter,” answered
the deep plaintive voice of the accused.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir George Bannerman,” said Lord Dazzleright, coming
to the side of the lady, “I stand here as the counsel of
Lady Montressor, if she will accept my services, and I take
exception to the question put to her, as improper.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, do you retain Lord Dazzleright?” demanded
the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are then the counsel of Estelle L’Orient?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am the counsel of Lady Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Ah! my lord! do not breathe that stainless name here!</em>
I have no claim to it! Thank God for this, at least—that
whatever happens, I can bring no reproach upon that
honored name! for it is not mine! I am poor Estelle
L’Orient, and yonder name is really my owner,” said the
thrilling passionate voice of the lady, as she shuddered and
averted her head.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>“Hush! hush my child! You must really keep silence, and
permit me to conduct this case. I shall deny their charges
<em>ab initio</em> and <em>in toto</em>, as we lawyers say. You are no more
the legal wife of yonder vagrant than you are of——well
let that pass! You are the Viscountess Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Oh! no, no, no!</em> great heaven, no! that sacred name—Lord
Montressor’s spotless name—must be kept holy from
the sorrow and shame that is gathering darkly over that of
poor Estelle L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While this low and hurried conversation was going on
between the counsel and his client, the magistrate sat back
in his chair, waiting. Seeing them at length silent, he
leaned forward and inquired of the counsel if they were
ready to hear the charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are ready,” replied Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I will proceed to call the witnesses—Madame
Gabrielle L’Orient will please to take the stand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The small, deep set, quick, black eyes of the little old
Frenchwoman, scintillated with cunning malignity, as she
came forward. The oath was duly administered and she
commenced her deposition. First, she identified the
accused as Estelle, the wife of Victoire L’Orient, and then
in polished French but broken English she testified to having
witnessed the marriage of her son, Victoire L’Orient,
and her pupil, Estelle Morelle, in the church of St. Etienne,
at Paris, on the 13th day of November, 18—: and, further,
to the fact of the said Victoire and Estelle having lived
together as man and wife, for the period of one year, under
her roof, at No. 31 Rue St. Genevieve, Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>While this witness was giving in her evidence, Lord
Dazzleright whispered his client,</p>

<p class='c013'>“If there is any point in her testimony, to which you
take exception, let me know it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The marriage was a private one, and unless I was
grossly deceived, she knew nothing of it at the time,” murmured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Estelle, struggling against the death-like despair
that threatened the annihilation of her faculties.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One moment, if you please,” said Lord Dazzleright, as
the witness was about to retire from her position, “this alleged
marriage is understood to have been a strictly private
one—how then did it happen, Madame, that you witnessed
it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suspect the children of their intention. I follow, I
pursue, I enter the chapel of St. Etienne. I witness the
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No cross-questioning could drive the woman from this
point; but on the contrary, only tended to consolidate and
confirm her in her loose-jointed evidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next witness called was the little old French priest,
who, having been duly sworn, first identified the accused,
and then testified to having both witnessed and assisted at the
marriage of Estelle Morelle and Victoire L’Orient, which
was solemnized on the 13th of November, 18—, by the
Abbe Pierre Leroux, in the church of St. Etienne, Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cross-questioning of this witness elicited nothing to
throw discredit upon his testimony.</p>

<p class='c013'>The certificate was then exhibited. And the fact of the
first marriage seemed established. The next proceeding was
to prove the identity of Victoire L’Orient, as the living husband,
and consequently as the legal obstacle to the second
nuptial. This was easily done by the testimony of the
mother and the priest. The next and final fact to establish,
on the part of the prosecution, was that of the second and
so called felonious marriage, that day celebrated at the
parish church of Hyde. This was formally proved by the
testimony of the same witnesses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Lord Dazzleright, with a smile of encouragement,
stooped and spoke aside to his client.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Reassure yourself, Lady Montressor! This was from
first to last a series of conspiracies; I shall easily overthrow
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>them with their own weapons; hoist these engineers with
their own petard——”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then turning to the magistrate, his smile of benevolence
changed to one of flashing scorn, as he said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We might commence, your worship, by contesting the
legality of these proceedings, from the moment of the
issuing of the warrant, in itself informal, as not containing
the name of the accused, which is not Estelle L’Orient, but
Estelle Viscountess Montressor. But we choose to rest our
defense, not upon a mere verbal form, but on the deepest
and firmest foundations of justice and truth. We shall
therefore commence by denying <em>ab initio</em> and <em>in toto</em> the
validity of the alleged marriage, said to have taken place
in the chapel of St. Etienne, in the city of Paris, showing
the same to have been a felonious act, the result of a conspiracy,
in which my client was not principal or party, but
victim—a crime punishable by the statute laws of France
with fine and imprisonment. I shall show that, dating from
the edict of the <cite>14th of Henry II.</cite>, the statute laws of
France forbid the marriage of a minor without the knowledge
and consent of her parents or guardians, and vacate
such marriage, so contracted, as illegal, invalid, and of none
effect.”<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c013'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. In the old chronicle of the Kings of France from Pharamond to Henri Quatre,
written by the Sieur de Mezerai, occurs this paragraph, which is curious as the
origin of the statute affecting the marriage of minors in France. The date is 1557
of our Lord, and 10 of the reign of Henry II.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One cannot too often, or in too large characters, make mention of a couple of
Edicts which were made this year: The one, to retrench the abuses of Clandestine
Marriage, vacated all Marriages made by the Children of any Family without the
consent of their Father and Mother, unless the Sons when they contracted were
above Thirty years of Age and the Daughters above Five and Twenty. And to put
the stronger curb on the amorous fancies of young, giddy People, they added the
penalty of Disinheritance. The particular Interest of the Constable (De Montmorenci)
procured this Edict. His eldest son had engaged himself with the Damoiselle
De Pienne, a very beautiful Woman and of a good House, by verbal Contract:
the Father desired to disengage him from her, to match him with the King’s natural
daughter, the Widow of Horace Farnese.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It is not our intention to follow the “learned counsel”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>minutely through all his argument, in which he displayed
much zeal, legal lore, ingenuity and tact, and by which he
temporarily effected, in the feelings and sentiments of all
his hearers, with the exception of the prosecuting party, a
powerful revulsion in favor of the accused. He exposed
without mercy all the intriguing arts by which this designing
French governess and her unprincipled son had conspired
to inveigle their pupil, then a mere child, into a
clandestine marriage, by which they hoped eventually to
enjoy her immense wealth. He dwelt upon the moral turpitude
of that treacherous teacher in having thus betrayed
the sacred trust reposed in her by the parents of the child
confided to her care. He said that the criminal arts of this
intriguing mother and son should avail them nothing, either
in shape of profit or vengeance. And he concluded by
concentrating an immense mass of law, testimony and precedence
upon the point that this <em>quasi</em> marriage into which
they had conspired to entrap their pupil, was, without the
knowledge and consent of the parents or guardians of the
child-bride, null, ‘void’, invalid, and therefore could not form
a legal obstacle to the validity of the real and authorized
marriage that day solemnized at the parish church at Hyde.
He then required the discharge of his client from custody,
and sat down.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir George Bannerman acknowledged the conclusion of
his argument by a nod, and turned his face toward the witnesses
for the prosecution as if to express himself ready to
hear any thing they might have to advance against this.
The prosecuting party had no counsel, but in the absence
of a better lawyer, Madame L’Orient proved in her own
person, despite her sex and her broken English, an “indifferent
good,” or at least very shrewd advocate. And it was
the shrill voice of the little yellow, shriveled, and beady
eyed old French woman, that replied to the polished Lord
Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>She prayed Monsieur the Magistrate to remind himself
that the <em>statement</em> that Mademoiselle Estelle Morelle had
been married to Monsieur Victoire L’Orient, without the
knowledge and consent of her parents, was only an <em>assumption</em>
which required proof, while on the contrary, the <em>fact</em>
that this marriage between Monsieur Victoire and Mademoiselle
Estelle had been celebrated with the knowledge
and consent, and in the presence of Mademoiselle’s <em>guardian</em>,
was already proved, was established, was unquestioned;
for that she herself, Madame Gabrielle L’Orient, in
her capacity of governess and teacher, had borne the relation
of guardian to Mademoiselle Morelle. And as guardian
of Mademoiselle, her presence at the marriage of
Mademoiselle was all that was needed to make that marriage
a legal transaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having given this testimony, the vindictive little woman—her
black eyes scintillating in triumph—sat down.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright arose and scornfully disclaimed the
protestations of Madame L’Orient, utterly denying that her
office of teacher could have invested her, for a moment, with
the rights of legal guardianship over her pupil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame replied that she was not only teacher, but sole
custodian, governess and guardian of Mademoiselle for
many years.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here commenced a discussion upon this subject, ended at
last by the magistrate, whom it was easy to suspect of a
leaning on the side of the prosecution, and who now said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“This particular point is a matter for the adjudication
of their lordships the judges at the assizes. Has the defense
any thing further to urge?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—for though you choose to consider the illegality
of the first marriage a questionable matter—nay, though
you should decide to hold it a legal and binding transaction,
yet—we have much to advance, why my client should
not be held to answer to the grave charges upon which she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>stands before your worship. The English law, as also the
law of all Christian nations, very righteously constitutes the
<em>intention</em> the vital part of the crime; now that my client
had not the faintest shadow of <em>intention</em> or purpose to violate
the statute by her second, and as we hold it to be, her
<em>only</em> real marriage—is easy of proof. Two years ago there
was a published account of the death of this man, upon the
occasion of the wreck of the <em>Duc D’Anjou</em>. This account
was translated from the <cite>Courrier de France</cite> into the daily
Times, a copy of which I have just received from Lord
Montressor, and have the honor of laying before your worship,”
said Lord Dazzleright, drawing the paper from his
pocket and placing it upon the table before the magistrate,
who took it up and read, while the advocate proceeded—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My client saw this announcement, and believing herself
to be the legal widow of this man, retired from society and
remained in seclusion some eighteen months; at the end of
which time only, she accepted the addresses of Lord Montressor,
to whom she was this morning espoused as you
have learned.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Monsieur the Magistrate! but Monsieur! I pen—I
indite—I write much—many letters to Madame Victoire
L’Orient! I advise—I inform her of the life of my son,
her husband!” here vehemently interrupted the mercurial
little Frenchwoman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame, you are disorderly and will consult your best
interests by being quiet,” said the magistrate. Then addressing
the counsel for the defense, he said—“This point
also is one for the adjudgment of their lordships.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a short pause, at the end of which the magistrate
inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has the defense any thing further to advance?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The defense has nothing further to advance <em>here</em> and
<em>now</em>,” replied Lord Dazzleright, with a peculiar emphasis.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>“Then, Madam,” said the magistrate, addressing Estelle,
“I consider this a case for court, and I shall therefore bind
you over for trial to answer the charge of bigamy, at the
next assizes to be holden at the city of Exeter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The pale and drooping girl who had remained all this
time with her face bowed and hidden upon her hands in the
folds of her bridal vail, now raised her eyes in wild affright,
looking so much like an amazed and terrified child in the
grasp of some horrible power, that the good clergyman,
Mr. Oldfield, hastened to her side and stooped to say—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is but a form, my child. No action can be successfully
sustained against you. Trust in God, and take
courage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you bail?” inquired Sir George Bannerman, who
had just been giving some private directions to his secretary.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle shook her head—poor girl, she did not fairly understand
the purport of the question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor <em>has</em> bail, your worship. The Reverend
Mr. Oldfield and the Reverend Mr. Trevor stand ready
to enter into a recognizance with her, or rather with her
husband, Lord Montressor, for her appearance at court,”
said Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>The magistrate turned to direct his secretary to fill out
the proper forms. And while that functionary was busily
scribbling, Estelle turned to Lord Dazzleright pleading,</p>

<p class='c013'>“For the love of the Saviour, my lord! do not, oh! do
not continue to drag the spotless name of Montressor
through the mire of my misery! I would rather,—oh! far
rather, that conviction should come with all its train of
horrors for me, than that I should be saved, at the expense
of one speck upon that stainless name.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Without replying to her prayer, the advocate, turning
toward Lord Montressor, said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will your lordship be so good as to come and speak to
this lady? you may be able to bring her to reason.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Lord Montressor, who had heard or divined the purport
of Estelle’s plaintive petition, and who desired nothing more
than the opportunity of reassuring her, now came to her
side and said,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, my beloved, look up! I hold you as my dear
and honored wife, in whose cause it is both my duty and
inclination to risk, if needed, life and fortune, and sacred
honor. Estelle, beloved! you know that Baron Dazzleright
is at this time esteemed the most eminent lawyer in the
kingdom. His legal opinion is considered of the very first
importance. He holds the secret marriage into which you,
as an infant, were entrapped, ten years since, to be perfectly
void; and, on the other hand, the marriage solemnized between
us this day, to be perfectly valid. His opinion upon
the validity of our marriage, supported by the authorities
he adduces, and the developments of the last two hours,
has decided my course. I stand upon the legality of the
ceremony this day performed in the church of Hyde; I
claim the rights of a husband to protect and shelter you;
and here pledge my life if needful, my fortune, my unblemished
name and sacred honor to bear you blameless through,
the severe ordeal. Therefore, <em>Lady Montressor</em>, do not
again seek to cast off the support that is most righteously
your own, nor the honorable name that does not deserve
repudiation at your hands. Remember, that it is your
<em>husband</em> who requires this of you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor spoke with an air of beautifully blended
deference, tenderness, and dignity, almost impossible to
resist.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright’s fine face beamed with sympathetic
admiration—and clasping the hand of the noble speaker, he
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“God bless you, Lord Montressor, for you are very
right! and if there is a man—peer, or prince—in the empire
who could take, unquestioned, the position that you now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>take and discharge with delicacy and discretion, its difficult
duties, that man is your lordship. God bless you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But all this while Estelle, with her clasped hands hanging
down, her head drooped upon her breast, and her eyes
lowered to the ground, remained in mournful silence. Nor
did she once change her position, or look up, or speak,
until the magistrate called the two sureties to sign the recognizance
that was now ready. The two clergymen advanced
to the table. Lord Dazzleright also followed, and
she was left standing alone, or guarded, as it were, by Lord
Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has my Stella no word or glance for me?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! my Lord—my lord—do you not <em>know</em> then that
poor Estelle’s soul is at your feet, in acknowledgment of
your matchless constancy! But, Lord Montressor, it must
not be as you have said. I may not lean upon your noble
strength, nor bear your honored name, and will not, my
lord—<em>will not</em>,” said Estelle, with mournful dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does my dearest Stella, my gentle <em>bride</em>,—with all her
graces,—lack the lovely grace of submission?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor Estelle, your <em>servant</em>, my lord, possesses with all
her faults and weaknesses, the capacity and strength to
suffer alone, alone! rather than drag one whom she honors
down to share her degradation.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your signature is wanted to this document, madam,”
said Sir George Bannerman, addressing the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Remain here, dear Estelle. I shall sign that instrument
in your behalf,” said Lord Montressor, leaving her
side and advancing to the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor will enter into a recognizance with
Messieurs Oldfield and Trevor, on the part of his wife,”
said Baron Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will not do. The prisoner must sign for herself,”
said the magistrate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be it so, then. Estelle—Lady Montressor—if you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>any regard for me, sign only the name that I have this day
bestowed upon you,” whispered Lord Montressor, as he led
her forward to the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor, I add my voice to his lordship’s, and
do beseech you, for the sake of all who love you, to comply,”
said the Baron.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle turned upon Lord Montressor a smile, full of holy
self-renunciation, took the pen, and with a firm hand signed
the paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, Lord Dazzleright, and the two clergymen
bent eagerly forward to read the signature. It was—<span class='sc'>Estelle
L’Orient</span>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, child, child! Why have you written thus?” questioned
Lord Montressor, with a look of distress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This girl will ruin her own cause,” said Lord Dazzleright,
in a tone of vexation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lords, she <em>will</em> ruin her own cause rather than
insure it at the expense of the noble and the good. I am
poor, lost Estelle, wife of Victoire L’Orient, and have not
the slightest claim even upon the Viscount Montressor’s
countenance—to say nothing of his noble name.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We will see about that, my fair fanatic,” said the Baron.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was now very late in the afternoon, and the setting
sun was shining aslant the sombre library wall, and as Sir
George Bannerman announced the sitting at end, and betrayed
symptoms of impatience to be gone, the parties,—both
prosecutors and defendants, prepared to retire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will go with me to Bloomingdale, my child, and
remain as long as your friends can spare you. Mrs. Oldfield
will be very—ahem!—will do every thing she possibly
can to prove her affection and respect for you, and to make
your sojourn in our humble home as comfortable and agreeable
as circumstances will admit, my dear,” said old Mr.
Oldfield to his protege.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We thank you very sincerely for your offered hospitality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>reverend sir; but since taking legal advice my plans
are again changed—we shall adhere to the first arrangement,
which was, that Lady Montressor and myself should
go down to Dorset and spend a month at our castle of
Montressor,” said the Viscount, with calm emphasis.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your lordship doubtless best knows the just and proper
grounds of your action,” said the venerable man, bowing
gravely, but looking, withal, so uneasy, that Lord Montressor
beckoned the baron to his side, and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Dazzleright, will you be good enough to inform
these gentlemen whom you consider to be the legal protector
of this lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unquestionably, reverend sirs, I hold the only legal
protector and proper custodian of this lady to be her husband,
the Lord Viscount Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But,” said the old clergymen, hesitatingly, “there is
<em>another</em> who claims that relation to this lady, and whose
claims the magistrate, however unjustly, certainly favors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And whose claims to any thing else but transportation
will certainly be set aside by the courts,” said the baron.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But in the mean time, for the lady’s own sake, had she
not better remain with me, or some other friend, until the
decision of the courts has confirmed her position?” pleaded
Mr. Oldfield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Decidedly not, sir; it would argue a doubt of her position—a
position upon the assuredness and stability of which
I am willing to stake my reputation. As the legal adviser
of Lady Montressor, I certainly counsel her ladyship to
place herself under the powerful protection of her husband,
and accompany him to Montressor Castle, to pass the time
until the meeting of the Judges.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, my love, you hear what the baron says. It is
getting late. Take leave of your friends, and permit me
to hand you into the carriage which waits, and drive to
your father’s house, where we will pass the night, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>since  to-morrow morning we will set out for Dorset,”
said Lord Montressor, who was very anxious to remove his
bride from the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My father! Ah, Lord Montressor, do you deem that
in all respects, Sir Parke Morelle resembles <em>you</em>! My
father will never look upon my face again, were that look
needed to save my soul alive. Nay, best and most honored my
lord, I <em>dare</em> not cross my father’s threshold, and I <em>will</em> not
cross my lord’s. If ever a Lady Montressor sets foot within
Montressor Castle, she will not first have borne the branded
name of Estelle L’Orient. Farewell, my lord. I repeat
now, what I said before, whatever may finally become of
poor Estelle, may God forever bless and love you, Lord
Montressor,” she said, bowing her forehead for a moment
upon his hand that she had clasped between her own; and
then releasing it, and turning away, she addressed the old
minister, saying gently:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am at your disposal, Mr. Oldfield, if indeed, you still
offer the shelter of your roof to one so lost as I am.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gladly, my child, will I receive you; and let me tell
you, Lady Montressor——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, <em>you</em> also, Mr. Oldfield; you will not spare my
lord’s name,” interrupted Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I very much suspect that it is your legal name, Lady
Montressor. I have the greatest confidence in the opinions
of Lord Dazzleright upon all <em>legal</em> questions, though I am
not sure I would be guided by his judgment in religious
questions. Thus I think his opinion upon the validity of your
marriage is likely to be quite right, while his advice to you,
(founded upon that opinion), that you should accompany
Lord Montressor to his castle in Dorset, there to abide the
action of the court, I consider to be erroneous. Your own
instincts, by the grace of God, have been a better guide.
It is fitting that you should remain with Mrs. Oldfield,
unless your parents claim you from us,” whispered the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>venerable man, drawing the arm of his protege within his
own, and preparing to leave the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Lord Montressor, who had remained a few minutes
in mournful silence now spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, Lady Montressor, my wife, I have not said
‘farewell,’ and I disclaim your right thus to withdraw yourself
from my lawful protection.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, your poor servant, Estelle, who
would lay down her life to serve your lordship, will not
even at <em>your</em> command, take one step to compromise or
injure you! Once more, farewell, my lord. And our God
forever love and bless you;” and with gentle firmness,
Estelle lowered her vail and turned away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still Lord Montressor would have detained and expostulated
with her, had not the Bishop of Exeter here come up
and reasoned with his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor does well. I have no doubt that
Lord Dazzleright is <em>legally correct</em>, but he is <em>morally
wrong</em>. I have no doubt that the marriage this day
solemnized at Hyde is perfectly valid and indissoluble; but
inasmuch as its validity is contested and remains to be
confirmed by the action of the court, I declare it my opinion
as a Christian minister that Lady Montressor is <em>religiously
correct</em> in withdrawing herself from the society of
your lordship until such time as the court has adjudged her
position; and that any other course would expose her
ladyship to much censure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see, now, that you are entirely right, my Lord
Bishop. Our wishes often blind us to what is expedient as
well as to what is right. Although, indeed, I wished chiefly
to consult her ladyship’s comfort and interests. I thank
you, sir, that you have placed this subject in its proper
light before me,” said Lord Montressor, frankly. Then
going up to the bride, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, love, you go now with my full consent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>approbation. Mr. Oldfield, it is I, her husband, who commits
<em>Lady Montressor</em> to your care,” he concluded, laying
a marked emphasis upon the title with which he wished to
invest her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your lordship does well. And Lady Montressor shall
receive the best possible care and attention while she sojourns
under our humble roof,” replied the aged clergyman.
And, bowing to the group, he led his charge from the
library, through the long passage, down the broad stairs,
across the wide hall to the entrance door, and thence down
the steps to the carriage in which he placed her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, Madame L’ Orient, Victoire, and the little
fat Abbe, chattering like a trio of mammoth magpies, had got
into their chaise and driven off.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, Lord Dazzleright and the Bishop of
Exeter, now came down the steps, entered the carriage of
the viscount, and took the road to Hyde.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Trevor came out, and joined Mr. Oldfield and Lady
Montressor, and their carriage was ordered to drive to
Bloomfield.</p>

<p class='c006'>The news of the arrest of a bride at the altar, upon one
of the gravest charges, and that bride, the beautiful and
gifted Estelle Morelle, the star of fashion, the patroness of
art and literature, the only daughter and heiress of the
oldest and wealthiest baronet in the West of England, and
the wife of one of the most distinguished among the young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>rising members of the house of Peers—fell like a thunderbolt
upon the world, and spread like a conflagration through
society. The story was everywhere received with incredulous
amazement. The very enormity of the offense charged
upon one so high and pure, stupefied belief. Even the reporters
and “item” hunters of the press, feared, for a time,
to deal directly with the question; and compromised the
matter by obscure hints, and initials, instead of proper
names. The most daring “sensationists” among the
country editors were held in check, not only by the judicious
limitation of the <em>license</em> of the press which exists in
England, but also by deep respect for, and perhaps awe of the
principal parties concerned. For the characters and influence
of Sir Park Morelle and of the Viscount Montressor were
not only paramount in their respective counties of Devon
and Dorset, but superior throughout the West of England.</p>

<p class='c013'>The affair was canvassed with never flagging interest by
people of every rank in society.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the evening of the arrest, the large kitchen of the
“Morelle Arms,” the Inn at Hyde, where small farmers,
artizans and laborers most did “congregate,” was the scene
of a considerable excitement upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>Along on benches placed each side a strong oaken table,
sat perhaps a dozen rough-looking countrymen, clad in
frieze coats or in smock frocks, and having clay pipes between
their lips, and pewter pots of foaming “arf-’n-arf”
before them. In an arm-chair at the head of the table, sat
John Oates the baker, like a self-installed moderator of the
feast, while at the foot, on an oaken stool, was perched
Peter Barktree, under-gamekeeper from Horsford.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fat little landlady was ever bustling in and out, between
the kitchen and the adjoining bar, pausing now and
then to catch a word of fresh news upon the all-engrossing
subject which they were discussing with so much zest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wot’s been done with un?” inquired Bob Sounds, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>well-digger, of his next neighbor, Peter Barktree, who
having come in from Horsford, might be expected to know
something satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay mon, wot’s been done with un?” echoed all the
others.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Oie</em> dunnoa. How should <em>Oie</em> know, only wot Bill
Moines sayt? Bill Moines as works on the Yew-tree farrum
at Horsford telled <em>Oie</em> how zhe was zent off to the
county jail. But <em>Oie</em> dunnoa, how zhould <em>Oie</em> knoa?” replied
this specimen of either stupefaction or caution—it was
hard to tell which.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humph! how zhould Bill Moines knoa, an he did wurruk
on the Horsford farrum?” queried a doubter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Oie</em> dunnoa. He wur up to the great house and saw
the carridges drive off mebbe; but I dunnoa; how zhould
<em>Oie</em> knoa?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bill Moines loied, and Peter Barktree nows nowt on it.
John Howe, the constable, toolde me as his worship had
sent un off with his ruverence Muster Oldfield to stay tull
the triall,” said the baker from the head of the table; and
having taken the pipe quite out of his mouth to deliver this
judgment, he now to save time immediately replaced it
and smoked the faster.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wot time will the trial be!—Quardar Zezzions!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Noo, mon, (puff,) it’s a piece of wurruk for his ludship,
(puff, puff,) and wull coome before the Zizes, (puff, puff,
puff,) and they will be open next week,” replied the competent
baker and dictator, smoking vigorously between his
oracular words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And wot will they do with zhe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Saying it goo agin un, zend un to the tre’d’ll.”<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c013'>“Oy, but they wull ne’er do the loike of that to zhe,

<p class='c013'>“And whoy zhouldn’t they do it to zhe as well as to

<p class='c013'>“Oy, oy, Tom! zo we zay. Wot’s law for the poor
zhould be law for the quality. A health to Tom Stallins!
Here, Mother Higgins, more ale! Wot’s Boot’ny Bay for
poor Tom Sawyers, zhoold be Boot’ny Bay for—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hold your blaspheming tongues of ye! Botany Bay,
indeed! They’d never send the likes of her ladyship to
prison for one minute, no matter what she was left to her
own devises to do, let alone Botany Bay. Is her blessed
ladyship, Tom Sawyers, ye brutes? Shame on ye! And
she the sweetest angel as ever went without wings. Shame
on ye! And she educating all yer children, and clothing
all yer old mothers, and lifting half the burden of life from
your good-for-naught shoulders ever since she came home
these ten years back—shame on ye! I say again, ye great,
stupid, unfeeling brute beasts! to take her sweet name on
yer lips!” exclaimed the little landlady, unable longer to
repress her indignation at hearing her “angel’s” calamity
thus freely discussed, and therefore quite ready to sacrifice
her interests to her feelings, and offend every guest in her
kitchen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Coom, coom, Mother Higgins, dooant thee get hoigh
with us. Give us zoome more ale,” replied the baker, holding
his pewter pot up for replenishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then, keep a civil tongue in yer heads, and know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>who ye’d be talking about, ye stupid loons, ye! That
French frog-eater as the Evil One has sot on to pretend to
her dear ladyship, has no more right to lift his eye to <em>her</em>
than old Bony has to the crown of England.” Speaking
of “Bony” probably suggested battle, for the honest woman
went on to say, “And more betoken, they do tell me how
the Frenchman stole her from a boarding-school while she
was a child; and if so be he should get her <em>now</em>, it would
cause a war with France.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Chut, dame; wot do thee knoa aboot politics and war?
and whoy should ’s majesty go to war aboot two yoong uns

ludship’s oon mon, says how his ludship, Lud Muntresser,
do stick to it as the Frenchman had noo roight to coome
here giving trooble; and his ludship wull stand by the
lady, een noo that her oon fayther and moother hev cast
un off, and more zhame for um,” said Mr. Stiggins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay will he, I’ll warrant ye! And a right noble gentleman
he is,” exclaimed the landlady.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zo he is! zo he is! and here’s to Lud Muntrussor!”
agreed the baker, tossing off the foaming bumper just
placed in his hand by the dame. And similar discussions
to this were taking place in every ale-house, tap-room, and
tavern-kitchen in the three counties, as far as the news had
flown.</p>

<hr class='c019'>

<p class='c013'>The morning after the preliminary examination, the elegant
boudoir of Lady Bannerman was half-filled with morning
callers, who had “just happened in” to hear a true,
authentic report from first quarters of this most wonderful
of scandals. Ladies whose charms had long been thrown
in the shade by the peerless beauty and genius of Estelle
Morelle, now canvassed without mercy her sudden fall.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>“Sweet Providence, what a coming down! What a
thunderbolt to the whole family! Arrested at the altar
upon a charge of——! Was such a thing ever heard
of!” exclaimed the Honorable Mrs. Howard Kennaugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush-sh! my dearest love; pray do not specify the
offense in the presence of my daughters—the dear girls are
so unsophisticated—their minds are so pu-err, I am perhaps
just a little prudish in speaking before them,” cooed
Lady Bannerman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a crushing blow to Sir Parke’s pride,” said Lady
Mary Monson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a shock to Montressor,” drawled Mrs. Bute
Trevor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what a life of deception that creature must have
led, to have deceived her parents and her betrothed so
effectually,” said Mrs. Howard Kennaugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what could she have <em>expected</em> other than, sooner
or later, just such a denouement as the present?” inquired
Lady Monson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, you see, my dear, the fellow was in a foreign prison;
she never expected him to get free; and when he returned
so very inopportunely, why she affected to have believed
him dead,” explained Lady Bannerman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, the unprincipled wretch! What a happy thing for
you and your sweet daughters, my dear Lady Bannerman,
that you were never on visiting terms with the family at
the Hall, and will not have the awkwardness of breaking
with them as some of us shall,” said Mrs. Bute Trevor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A very happy circumstance, indeed, I assure you; I
esteem it, madam,” returned her deceitful ladyship, who,
even at that darkest moment, would have given the largest
diamond in her parure to be placed on the dinner list of
Lady Morelle, and deemed the honor cheaply purchased.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They say that Miss Morelle, Madame L’Orient, or Lady
Montressor, whichever she may properly be named, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>really one does scarcely know how to choose among her
various <em>aliases</em>, has been cast off by her parents. What
do you think of it, Mrs. Kennaugh?” asked Mrs. Bute
Trevor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, dear, I think it no wonder! she had deceived them
so deeply, and shocked them so dreadfully! If they could
only cast off the cleaving dishonor with the daughter, it
were better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, but that will <em>cling</em>; I wonder if they will be visited
by any one?” suggested Lady Monson.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really, it is impossible to say. As far as our family
are concerned, if we had ever been on visiting terms with
them, it would be out of the question for us to continue an
acquaintance with a set so seriously compromised,” said
Lady Bannerman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gracious Heaven, only to reflect upon it! One can
scarcely realize such horrors,” said Mrs. Howard Kennaugh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“When does the trial come on?” inquired Mrs. Bute
Trevor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As soon as the Easter Assizes are open at Exeter. The
case will come up before the new judge, Sir James Allan
Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir James Allan Parke, my dear? And he is the new
judge! Why, is he not a relative of Sir Parke Morelle?
Maternal uncle, or cousin, or something of the sort? It
will be a strange beginning to have to try his own relative,
will it not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That trial will be a solemn farce, of course; nobody
expects conviction for <em>her</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, just Heaven, will the acquittal of the court remove
the dishonor that will attach to herself and all her family?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course it cannot restore her to the social position
that she has forfeited.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To think of Estelle Morelle in the prisoner’s dock!”
exclaimed Mrs. Howard Kennaugh, who seemed to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>an attraction toward the most painful and humiliating
points of the case.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! and then if she <em>should</em> happen to be convicted,”
suggested Lady Bannerman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What would be done with her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She would be sent to the convict colonies. It is a
transportable offense.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ugh! I suppose in that case her parents would never
show their faces in England again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They will go abroad in <em>any</em> case, of course. For my
part, I think that inasmuch as the girl has been arraigned,
she had just as well be condemned. It can make but little
difference, and to ship her to Australia will end the difficulty,
and be a sort of way of providing for her. Her
parents are going East, and Lord Montressor has applied
for an Ambassadorship to America.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mamma, dear, do you know I think <em>that must</em> be a
mistake? For I heard from Mrs. Burgess, the niece of the
Bishop of Exeter, that his lordship intended to assert and
stand upon the legality of his marriage, and to sustain his
lady,” said Miss Bannerman, upon whom all eyes were now
turned in astonishment at this annunciation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Louise, my dear, we must not believe half that we
hear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, dearest mamma, his lordship really <em>did</em> place her
under the protection of Mr. Oldfield to await the event of
the trial.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ridiculous, my love. His lordship had nothing to do
with it; Mr. Oldfield took the poor lost creature into his
house as an act of Christian charity. You know, my sweet,
that a <em>clergyman</em> can do any thing of that sort, which no
one else could dare to do; because his holy cloth will
‘cover a multitude of sins’—<em>of others</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, dearest mamma, Mrs. Burgess told me that it was
<em>all</em> his lordship’s doings, and that in placing her under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>protection of Mr. Oldfield, he gave him and his family to
understand that she must be addressed only by the name
and title that he had bestowed upon her, and that he chose
to consider her own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly preposterous, my darling girl! a peer of Lord
Montressor’s exalted rank compromise himself with a questionable
woman? Perfectly preposterous!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, mamma dear, he is said to be devotedly attached
to her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tut, tut, tut, my best Louisa, pray do not be absurd!
Lord Montressor attached to <em>her</em> in view of all that is past,
and present, and to come? Preposterous! Perfectly preposterous!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And—“Preposterous! Perfectly preposterous!” was
echoed by all the ladies present.</p>

<p class='c013'>And this scene was but a type of a score of other such
scenes then transpiring in the boudoirs and drawing-rooms
of Devon, Dorset, and Somerset, where this subject was
discussed as far as the news had spread. But, notwithstanding
the ladies had characterized the idea as “preposterous,”
the fact was now forced upon their convictions,
that Lord Montressor did mean to spread the aegis of his
powerful name and protection over Estelle during her terrible
ordeal.</p>

<p class='c013'>It became known, as every thing even of the most secret
nature does, in some mysterious manner, that Lord Montressor
had called upon Sir Parke Morelle in behalf of his
daughter.</p>

<hr class='c019'>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor in fact suffered one night to pass, during
which he hoped Sir Parke Morelle might recover from the
first madness of rage into which he had been thrown by
this terrible shock to his pride and affection, and then his
Lordship had called at Hyde Hall and requested a private
audience with the Baronet. He was shown into the superb
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>library where he found Sir Parke reclining in a luxurious
arm-chair with a reading stand beside him, and engaged in
reading, or in pretending to do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor advanced with serene gravity, offering
his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke arose to welcome him, and stood, slightly
bent, trembling and leaning for support with one hand
upon the chair. The Baronet had aged twenty years in
less than twenty hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, Sir Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, my lord. Pray be seated.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor waived his hand, nodded, took the indicated
chair, and when Sir Parke Morelle had resumed his
seat, said,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I called this morning, Sir Parke, believing that you
would be pleased to hear favorable news relating to Lady
Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Baronet’s face suddenly blanched, his lips worked,
his brow gathered, but his over-mastering pride soon controlled
every betrayal of emotion, and he inquired, coolly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“News relating to——<em>whom</em>, my lord?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To your daughter, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your Lordship labors under some serious mistake. <em>I
have no daughter</em>,” said the Baronet, sternly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No daughter? That is very sorrowful, if true; you
lately gloried in the loveliest daughter in all Devon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We will not speak of her, if you please, my lord,” said
the baronet haughtily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be it so, I will drop the subject of <em>your daughter</em>; but
will you, sir, on your part, be so courteous as to permit me
to speak for a few moments of, <em>my wife</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was not aware, Lord Montressor, that you <em>had</em> a
wife.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I have the honor of informing you of that fact.
Yes, sir, I have the loveliest wife, as <em>you</em> had the loveliest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>daughter, in all Devon; I have not lost her; and it is of
<em>her</em> that I come here to talk.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord! with all deference to your lordship, I must
inform you that <em>I</em> do not <em>know</em> Lady Montressor; nor is it
convenient just at present to form her ladyship’s acquaintance.
We are about to leave England for some time, my
lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Parke!” said Lord Montressor, very gravely, “let
us leave this unworthy word-fencing, and talk of this matter
as Christian <em>men</em> should discuss it—shall we not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The baronet’s countenance was working again; he
sought to control its emotions; he sought to repress the
feelings that were swelling in his bosom; he was “very
vilely proud,” but his pride was scarcely proof against the
earnest goodness of Lord Montressor’s nature.</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship saw this advantage and pursued it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you will exercise the moral heroism of looking this
dark matter steadily in the face, you will understand it
better—summon patience and strength, while I tell you as
much, and no more than it is requisite you should know, of
the present position of affairs relating to—my wife.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Lord Montressor commenced, and while the baronet
listened with his chin upon his breast, and his hand thrust
into his bosom, told with all possible delicacy what had
passed, and concluded by saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus the law and the testimony, as understood by the
most eminent barrister in the kingdom, hold Estelle to
have been, while yet an infant, the victim of a conspiracy,
and entirely set aside the <em>quasi</em> marriage of the child, in
favor of the real marriage of the woman. Therefore, sir,
I shall use the power with which the law undoubtedly invests
me to protect and defend Estelle in her present straits,
and when these shall be safely past, leaving the conduct of
her future life to be decided by her own conscience and
moral free agency.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Leaning his head upon his thin worn hand, Sir Parke
turned his glance wistfully upon the face of Lord Montressor.
His lordship’s calm, self-possessed independence of thought
and action amazed this world-worshiper. But Sir Parke’s
thoughts, affections, and activities revolved in a very contracted
orbit—from pride to self-interest, and from self-interest
around again to pride—and as neither of these
passions could in any degree be gratified by any sort of
relations with Estelle, he judging the motives of others by
his own, could not at all understand the grounds of Lord
Montressor’s action. But then the humanity, liberality and
independence of Lord Montressor had often suggested the
suspicion to the baronet that his lordship was a little wrongheaded
upon some subjects, and that was the only way, he
thought, to explain his present otherwise inexplicable conduct.
When Lord Montressor paused, he spoke, though
somewhat off the point.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since we <em>are</em> discussing this subject, which you have
rather ungenerously forced upon me, my lord, I must use
the opportunity afforded me of assuring your lordship that
at the time of your betrothal to Miss Morelle, neither Lady
Morelle nor myself had the slightest grounds for suspicion
that there had existed on the side of the young lady, a
previous entanglement.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am assured of that, Sir Parke; though I myself had
been duly advised of all this by Estelle, who would have
placed a like confidence in her father had she dared.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As much as Sir Parke was surprised by this avowal, he
was much too guarded to permit his astonishment to appear;
while Lord Montressor proceeded to say:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, this is not the point, sir; what I wished to inquire
is whether—now that you are made acquainted with the
position of affairs—you will assist me in sustaining Estelle.”
There was a pause. For a few minutes pride and affection
had a mighty struggle in the bosom of the Baronet, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>no one could have guessed it from his calm exterior, and
then he replied, slowly:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not, my lord. You, from the infatuation of
passion, and Mr. Oldfield, from Christian charity, may unite
to protect and defend her; and the literal construction of
the statute may save her from the ultimate consequences of
her folly, but Estelle has fallen, and no fallen woman must
dare to call me father, or look to me for aid and countenance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>An indignant rejoinder rose to Lord Montressor’s lips;
he was tempted to inquire of him by whose culpable neglect
it was that the child of seven years had been left to grow
up under the sole charge of an unprincipled and intriguing
French governess, who ended by entrapping and nearly
destroying her pupil; to ascribe all the wretchedness that
had ensued to his own failure in parental duty, and to hurl
the charge of dishonor back into the teeth of the cold, hard,
haughty man who had made it; but “He who ruleth his own
spirit is mightier than he who taketh a city,” and Lord
Montressor forbore by angry words to widen the breach
between father and daughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“God give you a more humane heart, Sir Parke,” he said.
“When do you leave England?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Within ten days,” answered the baronet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He wishes to escape before the opening of the Assizes.
Well, well, be it so! only with augmented earnestness let
me pray God to purify my heart from every earthly passion,
and every selfish motive, that I may be the fitter champion
of His poor child, whose earthly father and mother have
forsaken her,” thought Lord Montressor. Then he inquired—since
they were so soon to leave England—whether
he might not be permitted to pay his respects to Lady
Morelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the baronet prayed that he would excuse her ladyship,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>who had not yet recovered the severe shock her nerves
had sustained in this affair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor then left his compliments and best
wishes for Lady Morelle, and arose and took leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>Worldly pride was the governing passion of Sir Parke
and Lady Morelle. Just so long as their only daughter
had been an object of pride to them, they had idolized her;
now, however, when reproach had fallen upon her youthful
head, and she had become, though undeservedly, an object
of animadversion, they were the first to reject and disown
her; as had new honors, however unmerited, crowned her
they would have been the first to applaud.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile how passed the time with her who, stricken
at her meridian culmination of honor and happiness, had
fallen so suddenly and so low?</p>

<p class='c013'>We left her seated in the carriage with Messrs. Oldfield
and Trevor, on the road to Bloomingdale parsonage.
Closely enveloped in the bridal vail, which she had as
yet no opportunity of changing, she sat back in a corner of
the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was too absorbed in her despair to notice the beautiful
country through which their road passed, winding
among wooded hills, down through flowery dales, or between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>high hedges, thickly matted and overgrown with the
fragrant wild rose, the maythorn, and the sweet honeysuckle,
and shutting in some richly-cultivated field or garden;—or
to listen to the music of the thousand choristers of nature,
now singing in concert their vesper hymn.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun went down amid a gorgeous blazonry of crimson,
purple and gold; darkness crept over the heavens and
the earth, and the stars came out, first one by one, and
then in scores, and then in hundreds, until myriads of angel
eyes seemed to look down from the firmament, and presently
the full moon arose and flooded all this beautiful scene with
silvery splendor; and still Estelle, buried in the depths of
her despair, remained unconscious of time, or of the change
of lights.</p>

<p class='c013'>Neither of her companions addressed her, thinking it was
better that, after so much excitement, she should be left to
her own reflections, if haply she might gain repose.
Neither did they, in their respect for her grief, speak the one
to the other; the ride passed in almost total silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was late, and the moon rode high in the heavens,
when the carriage turned into the narrow, shaded and
decliving road leading down to Bloomingdale.</p>

<p class='c013'>The place, as its name indicated, was a small, deep, verdant
dell, settled down among crowded hills, in the midst
of which nestled near together the little antique gothic
church and the cottage parsonage; the cottage garden being
divided from the church-yard only by a hedge, and the
whole surrounded by a stone wall; and all—church, cottage,
wall and hedge, so completely overgrown with moss,
ivy, and creeping vines, and so densely crowded with shrubs
and trees, as to be indistinguishable except by the spire rising
from the clump of elms, and indicating the character of
the obscured outlines.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are at home, dearest child,” said Mr. Oldfield, as
the carriage stopped.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>The footman sprang off from behind, opened the door and
let down the steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Trevor alighted, followed by Mr. Oldfield, who handed
out his protege. They were before a low garden gate, surrounded
by an arch all overgrown with honeysuckles, whose
pendent tendrils kissed their heads in passing through.
They entered by this a semi-circular walk, under a lattice
work, covered with grape vines, and leading around to the
front portico of the cottage, which was covered closely, as
was the whole house, with a matted growth of running
roses, clematis, jessamine, flowering ivy, and every description
of beautiful and fragrant climbing vine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Within this green and blooming bower alight, in a shaded
alabaster lamp, shone purely as a moon over the darkly-polished
oaken door.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rector drew the arm of his charge protectingly within
his own, and led her into this portico, and rapped.</p>

<p class='c013'>His summons was answered by a neatly-dressed, red-cheeked,
bright-eyed servant maid, who opened the door
and smiled and courtesied on seeing her master; but immediately
started and stared with open-mouthed wonder at
the white-vailed form shrinking near him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, come, Sarah my good girl, let us in! What
are you thinking of? Your mistress is——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, in the parlor!” exclaimed Sarah, recovering
her self-command, and springing aside.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Show us in there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” said Sarah, opening a door on the left side of
the hall, and revealing one of the coziest of English home
scenes.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a medium-sized parlor of faultless neatness and
cleanliness, comfortably carpeted and curtained; warmed
by a glowing fire of seacoal, in a polished steel grate, that
the chilly spring evening rendered acceptable; each side
of this fire-place were deep recesses, from ceiling to floor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>filled on the left by a tall book-case of favorite volumes,
and on the right by a high cabinet of shells, minerals, ores,
coins, medallions, storied old china, and other objects of
vertu. Soft, deep sofas, easy chair, and foot-cushions, of
various styles, to suit every need, and tables and stands for
every reasonable parlor purpose, were conveniently arranged
around.</p>

<p class='c013'>But perhaps the most attractive article of furniture was
the neat tea-table that stood in the midst of the room, before
the glowing grate, covered with a milk-white, ample
damask table-cloth that reached the floor, and laden with
its glistening service of silver-plate and white china.</p>

<p class='c013'>In an arm-chair a little to the left of the table, sat a
stately old lady of perhaps sixty-five years of age, looking
not unlike the dignified housekeeper of Hyde Hall. She
was arrayed in a stiff black gown, with a surplice bosom,
open to reveal a glimpse of the snow-white muslin handkerchief
crossed over the bosom within; a white muslin cap,
with a very high and stiffly-starched crown, surmounted her
silvery gray hair and severe physiognomy, and added height
if not dignity to her appearance. On the other side, between
her chair, and the corner of the fire-place, was a
stand on which stood a lamp and a volume of what might
have been religious tracts, just closed and laid aside, with
her spectacles between the leaves to keep the place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Had Estelle been in a condition to notice any thing, she
might have been repelled by the severe aspect of this lady,
who the reader has already guessed to be Mrs. Oldfield, the
Rector’s wife.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Oldfield belonged to the old school of English
women of the middle classes. A rigid pietist, a severe disciplinarian,
a model wife, mother and housekeeper; she
had reared, in high respectability, a large family, had seen
her sons established in professions, had married off her
daughters to eligible and responsible men—in a word, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>completed her life’s work without a flaw or blemish, and
now at the age of sixty-five had sat down in perfect self-satisfaction
and very little charity for those who had been
less fortunate.</p>

<p class='c013'>As she saw the party enter, she arose, somewhat stiffly,
between formality, age and rheumatism, and stood ready to
receive her guests; but soon stared almost as wildly as had
Sarah Copley on perceiving the vailed bridal figure that
hung upon her husband’s arm; her first idea was, that their
old bachelor friend, Mr. Trevor, had resolved upon taking
to himself a wife, and brought the lady there to be married;
she frowned formidably in advance at this suppositions
irregularity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield sighed deeply as he noticed the rigor of her
first regards of one to whom he had dared to promise on
her part a mother’s tender care; he silently prayed that
when she should know all, the weight of her righteous indignation
might fall only on the guilty, not on the innocent
unfortunate. But her austere aspect, while as yet she knew
nothing to the disadvantage of the guest, (but that she
seemed to be placed in an embarrassing position,) filled him
with forebodings as to her future treatment of his charge;
while he thanked heaven for the mental abstraction from
outward objects that so shielded the already wounded heart
of poor Estelle from the arrows of unkindness in her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>All these thoughts on either side passed in much less
time than it has taken to tell.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is Lady Montressor, Mrs. Oldfield,” said the Rector,
presenting his protege.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady—Mon—tressor?” slowly repeated the hostess,
gazing searchingly into the pale, worn, most despairing, yet
perfectly beautiful face, that with its downcast eyes, was
now unvailed and bowed before her.</p>

<p class='c013'>She knew that Mr. Oldfield had gone to Hyde that morning
to assist at the marriage of Lord Montressor and Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Morelle, whom by the way she had not seen for years, and
could not now recognize in the sorrow-stunned woman before
her; but why should Lady Montressor, who was married
this morning, be here alone in bridal array, to-night?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I beg your ladyship’s pardon,” she said at length,
recovering her presence of mind, though by no means her
astonishment, and offering her own comfortable chair to her
visitor—“Pray be seated, Lady Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle mechanically sank into the proferred seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Trevor greeted his hostess, who welcomed him
kindly, and invited him to sit down.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rector threw himself into his own favorite leathern
chair, rubbed his hands with an assumption of cheerful ease,
and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now tea! tea! my dear! as quickly as it can be served.
This lady greatly needs refreshment, for I think she has not
broken her fast since morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, perhaps, Lady Montressor would prefer first to
retire to her room and change her dress,” suggested the old
lady, turning toward her guest and gazing with no abatement
of astonishment upon her strange attire, wondering
whether she had brought any baggage, and in fact wondering
all around the compass of which she formed the
centre.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Estelle did not reply to her suggestion, most likely
did not understand, or even hear it.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mr. Oldfield hastened to answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my dear, I think not; her ladyship’s trunks have
not yet arrived, and I think she will not feel disposed to
change until she retires for the night, which should be soon,
as she is really ill from fatigue. Therefore, tea! tea! my
good wife, as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then rising, and crossing over to Estelle, he said,</p>

<p class='c013'>“You would like to retire soon, my child, would you
not?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“Oh! yes—yes,” she murmured in a voice nearly extinct
with grief and weariness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—<em>where is his lordship</em>?” very naturally inquired
the correct old gentlewoman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor—is—ahem!—not here at the present
time,” replied the Rector, pointedly; but seeing that this
very direct answer failed to enlighten and satisfy his lady,
he added, “Come, come, my dear! there is no misunderstanding
between Lord and Lady Montressor; they are on
excellent terms. Well, of course, there is <em>something</em> to be
explained, which you shall hear in time! meanwhile, my
dear, tea, tea!”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was some comfort to be told that there <em>was</em> something
real and not to be left to imagine herself under the influence
of a wierd dream; and so the excellent woman, set somewhat
more at ease upon the subject of this strange bridal apparition,
rang and ordered tea, which was immediately served.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suffer me to relieve you, my child,” said the Rector,
gently, but rather awkwardly, officiating as lady’s maid and
unfastening and removing the vail and wreath from her
brow. “There, let me draw your easy chair to the table.
Do you hear me, dear child?” he inquired, uneasy at beholding
her look of apathetic despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! yes, yes, I hear, understand, and thank you, for
this and for all. I know—I remember, that but for you, I
should have passed this night—that was to have been my
wedding-night,—in prison,” she murmured in a deep heart-thrilling
tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘<em>In prison!</em>’” Mrs. Oldfield had heard these fearful
words, and involuntarily echoed them!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not mind her, my dear Madam—she—I mean, don’t
mind her,” whispered Mr. Trevor, to his hostess, whose
astonishment had returned with a vengeance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle, had she been less absorbed in her profound sorrow,
might have noticed the shocked and scandalized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>expression of the old lady’s countenance; but as it was, the
severe regards of Mrs. Oldfield fell harmlessly upon her
whom despair had rendered invulnerable.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, my child, you must really force yourself to take
something. Endeavor now to swallow some tea and toast,
for the sake of one in whose name I speak to you,” said the
Rector, gently placing his charge at the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Silently and mechanically Estelle did all that was required
of her, though the act of swallowing was almost
impossible. And now the deferential care of the two
clergymen for their fair charge again modified Mrs. Oldfield’s
ill suspicions of her guest.</p>

<p class='c013'>Directly after tea, at the suggestion of Mr. Oldfield, the
bell was rung, and the little bright-eyed maid, Sarah Copley,
was summoned to show Lady Montressor to her
chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Oldfield gave some directions in a low voice, aside
to her Abigail, who courtesied, lighted a night-lamp, and
stood ready to attend her ladyship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Silently and mechanically Estelle arose and bowing good-night
to the circle, followed her attendant from the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they had disappeared, Mr. Oldfield told the story
of Lady Montressor’s arrest at the altar, and the subsequent
developments relating to her school history. But no logic
or eloquence of the narrator, no palliating or explaining of
the circumstances, could serve to lessen in Mrs. Oldfield’s
estimation the moral turpitude of her whom this rigorous
judge persisted in regarding as a sinner of the deepest dye.
And the anxious and distressed rector had the utmost difficulty
in obtaining a promise that the unhappy lady, while
she remained their guest, should be attended and served
with the consideration due her rank. But this promise
once given, however reluctantly, he knew would be faithfully
performed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor reached her chamber, which was the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>front room immediately over the parlor, and which she
found neatly and plainly arranged, with a polished wax
floor, maple furniture, and white dimity curtains, bed hangings
and chair covers, and warmed by a bright little fire in
the grate. The cheerful maid laid out a delicate cap and
gown from her mistress’s wardrobe, and stood waiting Lady
Montressor’s orders. Estelle gently declined her further attendance,
and dismissed her.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then——</p>

<p class='c013'>For the first time since her appalling calamity, Estelle
found herself alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>She sank into an arm-chair, dropped her throbbing and
burning forehead upon her hands, and tried to recollect
herself and think coherently. For now that she was alone,
the fearful events of the last twelve hours seemed the wierd
and horrible conjurations of fever or nightmare. It was as
difficult as it was terrible to realize her position.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first stunning shock of the storm had passed. The
thunderbolt had fallen, and the charred and blackened
ruins of her happiness lay all around her. The whirlwind
had crossed her path of life, sweeping away her dearest
treasures. The waters of affliction had rolled over her soul,
bearing off her most precious earthly hopes. Yes, the first
shock of the storm had passed; but desolation was within
and around her, and the clouds still lowered, dark, heavy,
and threatening, over her devoted head.</p>

<p class='c013'>She rapidly reviewed the chain of circumstances—when
scarcely fourteen years of age, she had been ensnared by an
intriguing governess, and an unprincipled fortune-hunter,
into a secret marriage, soon bitterly repented by herself, and
disrupted by the man’s felony, and now pronounced to have
been from the beginning illegal. After ten years of separation,
and two of supposed widowhood, she had that morning
contracted a second marriage with a party of the highest
rank and character, which was said to be legal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>binding to all intents and purposes. Arrested on leaving
the church, upon a grave and degrading charge, she had
been discarded by her parents, who would probably leave
England forever, to conceal their humiliation under foreign
skies; but was protected, though most delicately, from a distance,
through reverend hands, by Lord Montressor, a man
of stainless honor, who would be the last on earth to sacrifice
moral principle to human affection, and who had in
view of the law and the testimony, declared his determination
to stand by the legality of their late marriage, had
given her the protection of his name and title; and exacted
of all others that they should address her only by that;
finally, she was bound over to appear at the approaching
assizes to answer the charge of a terrible and shameful
crime!</p>

<p class='c013'>Such was the past and present.</p>

<p class='c013'>What lay before her in the future?</p>

<p class='c013'>Her trial.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true that her counsel and her few devoted friends,
flattered themselves and her with the promise of certain
deliverance. But even her limited experience taught her
that very little dependence could be placed upon the prejudgment
of partisans, who always made it a point to sustain
the hopes of the accused by positive promises of acquittal,
which were not always confirmed by the verdict of
the jury. The law was proverbially uncertain. It was very
possible she might be convicted.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then—</p>

<p class='c013'>A vision of the convict cell, the transport ship, the
penal colonies, swam darkly before her mind’s eyes, turning
her soul sick with horror. It was but for a moment, and
then, strange to say, she regarded this possible result as
the condemned might regard the rack, the wheel, or the
stake—a frightful torture certainly, but one happily soon
ending in death. And merely saying—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>“I should soon sink under it, and that would be well,”—she
dismissed the vision, and turned to look upon the other—scarcely
the happier—contingency.</p>

<p class='c013'>She might be acquitted, as was confidently promised by
her friends, upon the ground of the illegality of the childish
marriage into which she had first been entrapped.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such were the uncertain prospects of the future.</p>

<p class='c013'>What now became her duty?</p>

<p class='c013'>For, with whomsoever the adjudication of her legal position
rested, that of her moral one remained, under these
as under other circumstances, with herself alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>What then was her duty?</p>

<p class='c013'>It might be indicated by circumstances.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the event of a conviction, her fate would be taken out
of her own hands, leaving her nothing to do, but simply
to submit and be patient until death should terminate her
sufferings.</p>

<p class='c013'>But on the other hand, with the issue of acquittal would
come a mighty moral problem, involving a terrible soul-struggle;
for then Lord Montressor would immediately
claim her as his wife; nay more, he would undoubtedly
have his traveling carriage in waiting to convey her directly
from the scene of her sufferings to his seat in Dorset,
or to some other peaceful retreat he would provide, where
the arms of affection should uphold and nurse her back to
life, health, and serenity. The laws of the realm would
sustain him in this course; the world, ever ready to bow to
success, would be his partisan; and deeper and more
potent than law, or world, the advocate in her own heart
was retained in his service and would plead his cause.</p>

<p class='c013'>Should she admit his claim, yield herself up to his higher
wisdom for direction, and with a child’s unquestioning trust
repose in the blessed haven of his large love?</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment, a vision of this sweet rest beamed in upon
her dark and troubled soul like the holy light of heaven.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>Should she give herself up to the happiness prepared
for her?</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a pause—a long pause, and silence in her
soul. Her conscience gave no affirmative.</p>

<p class='c013'>She only saw herself at a fork in the road of life from
which two paths diverged.</p>

<p class='c013'>The one splendid with sunshine, beautiful with verdure,
brilliant with flowers, and fragrant with their breath, musical
with bird songs, and more than all, blessed with the
presence of her noble beloved, who stood with outstretched
arms, wooing her to enter. But, was Duty there?</p>

<p class='c013'>The other, dark with cloud and storm, barren, silent,
solitary, desolate, no helping hand there held out to her,
no encouraging voice inviting her, she would tread it, if
tread it she must, alone, with tearful eyes and bleeding feet,
and staggering steps; yet not unblessed, if Duty were there.</p>

<p class='c013'>How should she decide? The question pressed itself
upon her conscience for solution. She would not try to
shake it off, to say—“Time enough when the trial is over”—for
she felt constrained to be prepared for the result of
that trial.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a terrible ordeal! one not to be safely passed
without much prayer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle sank upon her knees, and prayed long and earnestly
for light to see her duty, and for strength to follow
it. Who ever sought the Source of light and strength and
came away blind and feeble?</p>

<p class='c013'>The night spent in prayer brought a morning full of
peace and courage. She had decided what her course
should be in the event of an acquittal.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was eight o’clock before her bell summoned Sarah
Copley, who entered as usual, smilingly, and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you please, my lady, your trunks have come from
Hyde, and will you please to have them brought up here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, certainly, my girl, but how came they here?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Please, my lady, I don’t know; but when my master
sent back the Bishop’s carriage, he sent a note to Sir Parke
Morelle, I know, because I handed it to John, the footman,
to deliver; and, please your ladyship, the trunks came
about half an hour ago, and your ladyship’s own maid came
with them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What? Susan Copsewood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, your ladyship, shall I send her up? or would your
ladyship accept my services?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, my good girl, no; send up Susan Copsewood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, madam,” said the Abigail, disappearing.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few minutes after, Susan Copsewood entered, and
immediately upon the sight of her adored and unhappy
mistress, sank down at her feet, embraced her knees, and
burst into tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor laid her hand upon the girl’s head in
silent benediction. There was no utility in words as yet,
and none were spoken. When, however, Susan had wept
herself into calmness, and had arisen from her feet, and
stood waiting, Lady Montressor inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'>“How are my father and mother, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hem! dear lady, I always tell you the truth if I speak
at all. But now please excuse me from speaking,” said
the girl, sadly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! God, is it so?—have I nearly killed or maddened
my parents?” exclaimed Lady Montressor, growing deathly
pale and faint, and sinking into the nearest seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, then, I see I must speak! No, dear madam, Sir
Parke and my lady are not dead, nor are they any madder
than they always were—saving your presence; but, since I
must tell the truth lest worse be thought, they are both
very angry.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was to be expected! But what put it in your head,
kind girl, to come to me?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>“Why, no one put it there—it came there naturally, my
lady! What else could I do but come to you the first
opportunity? Last night about eleven o’clock, John
Brownloe, the Bishop of Exeter’s footman, brought a note
from Mr. Oldfield to master. I saw it handed to master’s
own man to be carried up. Well! soon the bell was rung
for me, and I was ordered to pack up all your ladyship’s
wardrobe, and have it ready to dispatch at four o’clock this
morning. So I went to work and did it. Just before I
strapped down the last trunk, master came in. And
‘Susan,’ says he, ‘have you strapped down all the trunks?’
‘All but this, sir,’ says I. ‘Lift up the lid,’ says he. I
did so, and he put a letter in——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A letter! Susan, my girl, where is it?” exclaimed Lady
Montressor, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the buff-colored trunk, my lady, which they are going
to bring up presently.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, as I was saying, dear lady, after I had packed
every thing up, and looked around to see if any thing had
been forgotten, lo and behold there was <em>myself</em> that might
have been left behind, if I hadn’t recollected, so I got ready
with the rest of your ladyship’s effects, to be sent off. Thus
at four o’clock in the morning I delivered myself along with
the trunks. ‘And who are you?’ says the drayman. ‘I
wasn’t hired to take no passengers, but only baggage,’ says
he. ‘Very well,’ says I. ‘I’m part of her ladyship’s baggage—lend
a hand and hoist me up.’ So after a little
more altercation, the stupid fellow let me up, and here I am,
your ladyship!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Susan; you——”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was here interrupted by a rap at the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a couple of plow-boys, who had brought up her
trunks. As soon as they were placed, and the boys had
retired, Lady Montressor hastened to take the keys from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Susan, and unlock one—the one indicated as containing the
letter. There it lay upon the top of all the contents—she
snatched it eagerly. Oh! might it bear one word of peace
and pardon to her sorrow-stricken heart! She tore it open.
It was an envelope, containing a check for a thousand
pounds, drawn in her favor, upon the bank of Exeter. No
more, not a line—not a word. With a deep sigh, Estelle
laid it aside, and sank into her chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>The maid, with a tact and delicacy above her condition in
life, selected from among the many rich dresses of the
trousseau, a morning robe of pale gray silk—the plainest
there, and laid it out for her lady’s use; and then, without
words, prepared her toilet; so that Lady Montressor was
ready to go below to meet the family at their nine o’clock
breakfast.</p>

<p class='c013'>As she descended, the hall door was open, and she looked
out. How beautiful, on this bright May morning, was the
parsonage and its surroundings,—a wilderness of flowers,
shrubs, and trees, with the old church spire rising from the
midst. Upon any other former day, this sweet rural landscape
would have filled the heart of Estelle with delight;
now, however, she only saw that it was lovely, and passed
on to the door on the right, leading into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The family were already gathered there. As she opened
the door, Mr. Oldfield arose and came to meet her, and with
a kind—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, my child; I hope you have rested well,”
led her to the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Oldfield treated her with stately courtesy.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mr. Trevor, with a smile and bow, placed a chair
for her use.</p>

<p class='c013'>Breakfast, that seemed only to await her arrival, was
immediately served. During that meal Mrs. Oldfield never,
except in strict necessity, addressed her fair guest; and
when she spoke it was with the most ceremonious politeness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>There was nothing to complain of, yet Lady Montressor felt
depressed and chilled; but she accepted this, as all else, in
the submissive spirit of expiation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Immediately after breakfast Mr. Trevor, whose charge
lay in the neighborhood of Montressor Castle, in the adjoining
county of Dorset, took leave, saying, as he held the
hand of Lady Montressor:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Though I depart from your presence, I remain in your
service, my child. When I can render you any assistance,
command me; I am ever at your orders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I earnestly thank you, sir,” replied Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Trevor was gone.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield went out to make parish calls.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lady Montressor was left alone with her hostess,
who, though polite, was not congenial.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon, therefore, Estelle retired to her chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her faithful maid had set the room in order, and was now
engaged in unpacking and hanging up her dresses in the
two clothes closets that flanked the fire-place. They formed
a part of that rich, tasteful, and costly trousseau that had
been provided for her bridal day’s vanities,—trifles certainly
they were at most; yet as mementos of the past, the past,
but only yesterday, yet seeming, by the yawning gulf that
divided it from to-day, so far apart, so long ago!—it was
painful to see them again! So Susan Copsewood instinctively
felt, and she hurried them out of sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have they sent my pocket Bible among the rest,
Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lady, here it is,” and the faithful girl handed
it to her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor received the blessed volume with reverence,
and sinking into her arm-chair, opened its pages to
seek for light and strength and comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that
have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>whom you shall fear: Fear him which after he hath killed,
hath power to cast into hell; yea, I say unto you, fear him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the words that first met her eye, and she felt
them as a message to her own soul. She read no further
just then, but softly dropping the book upon her lap, she
fell into deep meditation upon the word. Yes! amid all
the storm and terror of her position, the question presented
to her soul was the old, old question of simply doing right
or doing wrong. And her Judge, above all judges was—God!
Might he strengthen her to do her awful duty!</p>

<p class='c013'>While Lady Montressor meditated, read, and prayed in
her chamber, the news that she had sought sanctuary with
the Rector of Bloomingdale spread swiftly through the
neighborhood. And many were the friends and acquaintance
of the Rector’s family, who <em>happened</em> to drop in
during the course of that day. Some few among them
were personally known to Estelle, and these ventured to
inquire for her; but Mrs. Oldfield, after sending a message
to her guest, and receiving an answer, replied stiffly that
Lady Montressor preferred to keep her chamber, and declined
visitors. And so day after day passed, during which
Estelle secluded herself, or only appeared when summoned
to join the family at meal times.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, busy in her cause, forbore to visit or
even to correspond with his hapless bride.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright devoted the whole of his valuable time
and great legal ability to her case, and spoke confidently
of a fortunate issue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once during the week he called upon his client, and was
the first and only visitor that Lady Montressor, during her
self-sequestration, received. He came to gather from her
minute and detailed particulars of her school life, and
<em>quasi</em> marriage, and having possessed himself of all, and
taken notes, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“There can be no doubt as to the result of this trial. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>will be not only an acquittal, but a full and complete vindication.
Therefore, permit me to say, Lady Montressor,
that you do wrong to withdraw yourself from your husband’s
protection. Your course argues, on your part, a
doubt of your true position, which may injure your case,
when it comes before the Assizes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, there is a higher tribunal, at which, some day,
I shall have to appear, and I must act in view of that,”
replied the lady, in a deep, liquid, melodious voice, that
seemed to flow and ripple over the fragments of a broken
heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright looked suddenly into her face, and
through its dark and lovely features recognized the spirit
that could “suffer and be strong”—the spirit patient and
firm as sad. He sighed, and pressed her hand as he took
his leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day Estelle learned, through Susan Copsewood,
who had obtained the news from authentic sources, that her
parents had gone to Southampton, whence they would sail
in a few days for Italy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another blow! I accept it! Oh, God, I accept it!
Only make me patient to suffer, and strong to act!” was
the prayer that went up from her crushed heart, upon hearing
of this desertion.</p>

<p class='c013'>She opened her Bible to seek for comfort. Did an angel
guide her hand, or did the Lord of heaven and earth—the
Father of all, before whom not a sparrow falleth unmarked—thus
speak directly to his stricken child? For oh, words
of life and light! these were they that met her mournful
eyes: “Fear <em>thou</em> not; for <em>I</em> am with thee: be not dismayed;
for <em>I</em> am thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I
will help thee; I will uphold thee with the right hand of
my righteousness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She dropped the book and closed her eyes, for a flood
of blessing had descended upon her, enveloping and impenetrating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>her whole being, and filling her with Divine
love, wisdom, and strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>She needed all—love to teach her patience and forgiveness
under unjust contumely, wisdom to guide her in her
dark and dangerous path, strength to enable her to bear
the approaching terrible ordeal.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few days intelligence was received that the Judges
were within a few days’ journey of Exeter, and that the
Assizes would be opened on the following Monday.</p>

<p class='c013'>Good Mr. Oldfield heard this news with much more agitation
than was felt by his charge, who, pale and still,
awaited her fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Rector wrote a note and sent it by a special messenger
to Lord Dazzleright, desiring his lordship to come at
his earliest possible convenience and advise with him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright lost no time in complying with the
request, and arrived the next day at the parsonage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield immediately conducted his lordship into his
library, which was the room on the right side of the entrance hall,
opposite to his old wife’s parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they had reached this apartment, the Rector
handed a chair to his guest, and dropped himself into
another, saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Assizes are at hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it—thank Heaven, the suspense will be over,”
replied Lord Dazzleright, cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—I took the liberty of sending for your lordship to
ask—what am <em>I</em>, as Lady Montressor’s surety, expected to
do? Am I to wait here with her until a tipstaff summons
us to appear, or must I take her to Exeter, and render her
up? You see, though I am seventy years of age, I was
never in a criminal court in any capacity in my life, and
knew no more of its forms than a child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see: of course you are expected, without further
notice to bring your charge into court. But, anticipating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>this natural embarrassment on your part, I have brought
and left my carriage at the inn, and will call with it to-morrow
to take yourself and Lady Montressor to Exeter—if
you will accept.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, with promptitude, and many thanks, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In this case, then, all that you will have to do will be
to take seats in the carriage and leave the rest to myself,
as her ladyship’s counsel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am very grateful to have my mind thus far relieved,
my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall be at your door to-morrow morning, at ten—if
that hour will suit you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perfectly, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, as I have a world of business on my hands,
I must bid you good-day,” said Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-day, and many thanks, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning, at the appointed hour, Lord Dazzleright’s
carriage stood before the vine-shaded garden gate
of the parsonage.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a dark, gloomy, foreboding day, and sensibly
affected the spirits of all concerned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle prayed long and earnestly in her chamber, remaining
on her knees, until a gentle rap at the door, and
the voice of her faithful attendant, warned her that her
friends were waiting. Then she arose, and over her simple
grey silk dress wrapped a fine grey woolen shawl, put on a
close cottage bonnet of grey crape, threw over it a black
lace vail, took her gloves and her Bible, and followed her
maid down stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield waited in the hall, and Lord Dazzleright
in the carriage, to receive her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright’s kindness of heart suggested all things
needful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is her ladyship’s woman?” he inquired, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>greeting Lady Montressor, and observing that she was unattended.
“Is she not going with her mistress?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, nothing has been said of it, my lord; we did not
know that it would be convenient to your lordship to——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is that she? hasten, my good girl, throw on your bonnet,
and get in here beside me—did you not know your
lady would require your services?” said Lord Dazzleright,
interrupting the Rector to hurry the maid.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lord, I knew it well enough, only——” the
rest of her sentence was lost in distance, as she hurried
around the circular walk toward the house. She reappeared
in five minutes, and took her place in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lady Montressor and the Rector occupying the
back seat, and Lord Dazzleright and the maid the front
one, they drove rapidly off toward the Exeter turnpike.</p>

<p class='c013'>A long, dreary ride, under a dark and weeping sky, and
over a landscape humid with its fallen tears, brought them,
at the close of day, into the city of Exeter, the capital of
Devonshire, and the ancient seat of the West Saxon kings.
They drew up, and turned into the court-yard of a quiet
hotel in the neighborhood of the Assizes. There was no
registry of names required there, as in our own “free” country,
and therefore no gaping and staring crowd could identify
the pale, beautiful woman, who came attended by a
clergyman and an attorney, as the high-born lady, whose
approaching trial for a grave offense, occupied all thoughts,
and attracted crowds to the city; and no officious reporters
could publish the fact that—“Lady Montressor occupied
apartments at the ‘Crown and Sceptre.’” The next day
was the Sabbath, during which Estelle, escorted by Mr.
Oldfield, twice attended Divine service in public, without
attracting attention. She passed the evening in her chamber,
in prayer and self-communion, to be ready to meet the
morrow and the opening of the Assizes.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next day, Monday, May 15th, the Assizes were
opened with the usual attendant ceremony and bustle. And
a remarkably interessing docket had attracted crowds to
the spot.</p>

<p class='c013'>The case of Lady Montressor was almost the last on the
list, and divided public curiosity with that of Dlifp Oorak,
the Gipsy chief.</p>

<p class='c013'>At nine o’clock, closely vailed, and attended by the Rev.
Mr. Oldfield and her counsel, Lady Montressor left her
lodgings, entered the carriage, and was driven to the Courthouse.
Upon the proclamation of the public crier, that the
courts were now open, etc., etc., etc—she was handed from
the carriage, and still closely vailed, and leaning upon the
arm of her venerable friend, entered Exeter Hall, and proceeded
to the court-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle had never been inside a court before. At first
she had traversed the passage and staircase, blindly, behind
her vail, but when she found herself in a crowded room, impeded,
and finally nearly smothered by the pressure of the
masses, she drew her vail aside for air, and saw herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>within a vast hall, with an arched roof, marble pillars, and
Gothic windows, not unlike a lecture-room or church.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon an elevated platform, technically called the “Bench,”
placed at the upper end of the room, and enclosed by a
spacious iron-railing, sat the Judge, Sir James Allan Parke,
one of the most eminent of the judges on the Western Circuit
of England; he was a fine, hale-looking old gentleman,
arrayed in his official robes—a scarlet gown, ermine cape,
and full-bottomed wig. On the wall near his seat was blazoned
forth in large illuminated letters the king’s commission.
A little below him sat the clerk of the court. And
around—sitting, standing, walking about, or conversing,—were
the officers of the crown, in their official liveries, the
counsellors-at-law in their long black robes and white wigs,
and various nondescript individuals, who seemed to hold a
sort of middle place between official and non-official life.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the right hand, below the bench, was the prisoner’s
dock, an enclosure not unlike a pen, in which were gathered
some twenty persons of both sexes, and all ages, from twelve
to seventy. Lady Montressor’s eyes were spell-bound to
that miserable place. Such a set of wretched-looking human
creatures!—men, aye, and women and children, too!—with
faces stupefied with suffering, palsied by despair, or demoralized
by guilt!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven and earth!—is my place among these?” she
exclaimed, sick with loathing and terror. But in a moment
she rallied and rebuked herself. “Down proud heart,” she
said, “who hath made me to differ, and how much at last
<em>do</em> I differ from these my poor brothers and sisters? <em>I</em> fell
before the first temptation, though all my life was fenced
about from want, or care, or sin—while they—their lives
may have been one series of privations, trials, and irresistible
temptations! Who shall judge but God Omniscient?
God comfort them, and forgive me!” she prayed meekly
folding her hands and bowing her head.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>Her venerable protector, as inexperienced in these scenes
as herself, also contemplated that den of savage or brutal
faces, and grew pale with dread for his delicate charge. He
did not venture to turn his eyes toward Estelle, but instinctively
drew her arm closer within his own, and looked
around in distress for Lord Dazzleright. His lordship had
left them, and might now be seen conversing with the Judge.
Presently he bowed, left his position, and with a grave, sad,
almost angry countenance, slowly made his way through the
crowd, and approached his client.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well, Lord Dazzleright, well?” eagerly inquired
Mr. Oldfield, alarmed at the ill-omened expression of the
counsel’s face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! it is nothing! it is nothing!” said his lordship,
drawing his handkerchief from his pocket and wiping his
heated and perspiring brow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is not precisely <em>nothing</em>, Lord Dazzleright, judging
from your countenance and manner,” said Estelle, calmly
and firmly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my child, it is nothing to alarm <em>you</em>, although it is
something to displease me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me the truth, Lord Dazzleright.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will do so, Lady Montressor! I went up there to
examine the docket. I find our case is the last but two on
the list, and may not probably come up for a week or ten
days; I did not see the necessity of your ladyship’s presence
here in the interim. I had an opportunity of speaking to
the Judge, and showed him this, and prayed that my client
might be discharged from the obligation of attending court,
and suffered to remain with her bail, here in the city, until
the day upon which her trial should come up, when she
should again punctually present herself. The Judge chose
to refuse my reasonable request, and require my client’s
daily attendance here. And I am angry; that is all.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Except that you are also <em>anxious</em>, my lord! Is it not
so? Hide nothing from me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, certainly not <em>anxious</em>,” said the counsel, while his
looks belied his words,—“in no degree <em>anxious</em>, for though
this may appear unfavorable on the part of the court, yet Sir
James Allan Parke, if a stern, is a just Judge, and I rest our
cause upon its integral justice, not upon external favor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Umme! Oh—hh!” groaned the good Rector—“so she
is to remain here, poor lamb! day after day a spectator of
all the revolting horrors of a criminal court—and,” sinking
his voice to a whisper, “where is she to stand?—for the
love of Heaven, not there! in the dock among those loathsome
wretches?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright looked positively shocked and enraged.
“<em>There!</em> You astound me, Reverend sir! Those poor
outcasts are in the sheriff’s custody; daily he marshals
them from their cells to the dock, and nightly from the dock
to their cells. ‘He is king of that goodly company.’ Lady
Montressor, sir, is <em>your</em> holy charge; you only are responsible
for her appearance, and may make her position as exclusive
and as comfortable as you desire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, thank heaven! Since it is so then—pray let us
find a secluded and—I was going to say pleasant seat—as
if such a thing could be found in this place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Doubtless, a moderately agreeable one can be found
though,” said Lord Dazzleright, cheerfully putting aside his
anger, and offering his arm to his client, to conduct her
through the crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>But just as Estelle was about to accept the proffered
assistance, she perceived a hurried step approach from behind,
and a deep voice speak, at the sound of which, the
whole tide of life turned back upon its course, opening her
heart, and whelming her senses, in a mist of mingled rapture
and anguish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Permit me, my lord,” the voice said, and gently putting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>aside the counsel, Lord Montressor took the arm of his
bride and drew it within his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle’s whole being was thrilled with emotion, half
ecstacy, half agony, as I said. She turned away her swiftly
flushing and paling face, bowed her head and prayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, my lord! my lord! is this act of yours well conceived?—is
it prudent?—is it politic?” inquired the good
Rector, in distress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is <em>right</em>; beyond that I have not considered whether
it was politic, or prudent, reverend sir,” replied his lordship.
Then turning his face most tenderly down toward
the lady on his arm, he said in a low voice—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, my beloved, will you not look at me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>She put back her vail, lifted her head, turned up to him a
look of profound, unutterable, undying love then dropped
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak to me, dearest Stella.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, my lord! my lord! what can poor Stella say, but
echo what the minister said just now—‘Was this <em>well</em> done,
Lord Montressor?’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excellently well done, my Stella! You are my wife!
Where should I be, but beside my wife in her trial? Have
I not said that I would stand upon the legality of our
marriage. How shall I stand by our marriage, and desert
my wife? I never contemplated such an inconsistency
for a moment! It is true—for that no one should
venture to say, or hint, that selfish or unscrupulous
passion had governed my actions—I consented to forego
my rights and inclinations in favor of your delicate reserve,
and yield up to the care of Mr. Oldfield; and I forbore to
intrude, either by visit or letter, upon the sanctuary of your
private life. Now, however, the case is widely different.
You are before the public, before a judge, charged with a
crime, exposed to a severe ordeal. Shall I leave you to
tread this wine-press alone? No, no, so help me Heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>at my bitterest need—no! Before the same public, before
the same judge, through all the ordeal, will I stand by your
side, and with what manhood, strength and virtue there
may be within me, assert my position and your innocence.
Nor man, nor demon—world, flesh, nor devil, shall prevent
me doing thus! And may Christ so aid me in my greatest
extremity as I am true to thee! Amen,” he said, and reverently
bowed his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was vain to oppose a will like that of Lord Montressor.
Besides, he was approved by Lord Dazzleright, and felt to
be a tower of strength by Mr. Oldfield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We were about to find a comfortable seat for her ladyship,”
said the counsel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have already found one. Will you go with us, my
lord?—and you, reverend sir?” inquired Lord Montressor,
bowing to his two friends, and leading the way through the
crowd that respectfully divided to let him pass. He had
provided a seat in a distant and retired part of the court-room,
out of sight of the prisoners’ dock, and nearly out
of hearing of all that was revolting in the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here she sat, unobserved and unmolested for a time, Lord
Montressor, Mr. Oldfield and Lord Dazzleright standing as
a living shield between her and the eyes of the crowd.
There was little danger now, however, that she should be
troubled by the impertinent curiosity of others. For all
attention was now turned upon the proceedings of the court
at the upper end of the room. The jury was already empanneled,
and the first case on the docket called up. It
was that of Dlifp Oorak, the Gipsy king, indicted for the
murder of Sir George Bannerman’s gamekeeper. He was
now arraigned and standing at the bar. All eyes were
fixed upon him—a little dark, wiry figure of a man, with
sharp features and deep set glittering black eyes, thatched
with a wisp of wild black hair, and looking alert, spry and
restless, as if in another instant he would break loose,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>pound over intervening obstacles, clear the door or window,
and be away in the free air again!</p>

<p class='c013'>Even Lady Montressor, notwithstanding the absorbing
nature of her own sorrow, fixed her languid eyes upon this
savage child of nature, now bound and captive, and in
deadly peril of his life, and watched in hope and fear the
progress of his short trial. The forms were quickly dispatched;
the testimony on both sides heard; the exposition
of the opposite lawyers made; the charge of the judge
delivered; the case given to the jury, and their verdict
returned.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stand up and confront the jury;” was the order given
to the prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How say you, gentlemen of the jury, is the prisoner at
the bar guilty or not guilty?”</p>

<p class='c013'>For an instant there was a pause and silence in the court,
during which you might have heard a heart beat, broken
soon by the deep voice of the foreman pronouncing the
awful word of doom,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Guilty!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>He was only a Gipsy, and it had not taken the twelve
long to find their verdict.</p>

<p class='c013'>The prisoner was then asked if he had any thing to
advance as a just reason why sentence of death should not
be pronounced against him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dlifp Oorak laughed wildly, shook his black, elf locks,
and intimated that since the doom was to be only death, he
had no objection to make!—had it been a long imprisonment,
now, that were another matter! And the Gipsy
chief impatiently stretched his limbs and looked longingly
abroad through the tall gothic windows into the free, sunny
air.</p>

<p class='c013'>His attention was gravely recalled by the judge, who
donned the black cap, arose, and proceeded to pronounce
sentence.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The Gipsy heard his doom with an indifference and a
wandering of the eyes bordering on “contempt of court.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A little delay and bustle ensued, during which the sheriff’s
officers proceeded to remove the prisoner from court. In
going out, they passed very near our group of friends.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor noticed his half-savage, half-child-like
demeanor, caught a glance from his wild, deer eyes, and
silently offered up the care of his untutored soul to Christ.</p>

<p class='c013'>This prisoner had scarcely left the court before the second
case upon the docket was called. It was that of a young
girl charged with the crime of infanticide. The details of
this case were so painful, so revolting, that one by one
the women in the crowd vailed themselves and silently stole
away. While Estelle, the most delicate, sensitive and refined
of women, was compelled to sit there, between her
friend and her minister, and hear the whole! The trial
occupied three hours, and ended as the preceding one had
ended—in the conviction of the prisoner and sentence of
death.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So young! merciful Saviour! so young, and so horribly
lost!” cried Lady Montressor, in a stifled voice, covering
her eyes to shut out the vision of that girl’s white,
amazed, insane countenance! As the ruined one passed
out under charge of the deputy sheriff, she turned back
upon our group of friends, one wild, terrified, appealing
gaze, that reminded Estelle of the portrait of the Cenci and
remained fixed in her mind forever. She prayed for the
lost fellow-creature, and while she prayed the court
adjourned.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield with a deep sigh arose and was about to
offer his arm to his charge, when Lord Montressor, who
had remained standing, anticipated him, and drew the hand
of Estelle through his own arm. They made slow progress
through the crowd, and reached the portico, and went to
the street. On reaching the carriage, Lord Montrassor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>handed Estelle in, saw her comfortably seated, and then
said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before this tribunal and in public, dearest Stella, I must
assert at once our position—your innocence and my rights;
but,—that no one shall venture to call in question the
motives of my conduct or yours,—I shall refrain from intruding
on your private life, until the decision of your case
shall have endorsed our union. Farewell, I will meet you
here to-morrow, dearest.” And pressing her hand, he
bowed and gave way to Mr. Oldfield, who immediately
entered the carriage; and they drove rapidly to their
hotel.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the history of the first day at court; and the
second and third, and many succeeding days, were like
unto it—dreary, depressing, dreadful records of vice, crime,
and suffering, of every kind and every degree. There were
ten capital cases on the docket. And in that single session
of the Assizes at Exeter, Sir James Allan Parke pronounced
sentence of death upon seven persons, including
the king of the Gipsies, all of whom were hanged within a
week after their conviction.</p>

<p class='c013'>And day after day, in this fetid atmosphere of guilt and
death and horror, Lady Montressor sat and sickened—sickened
and despaired to see these poor outcasts of Christianity—these
sinning and suffering wrecks of humanity—men,
women, and even children, one after another, fall into the
horrible pit prepared by their own crimes. For the acquittals
were very few. English courts are stern and strict,
almost invariably endorsing by their action the warrants of
their justice, and the true bills of their grand jury. The
numerous, seemingly merciless convictions of the court,
wrung her heart not only with the most painful pity for
other sufferers, but with despair for herself and for those
deeply interested in her fate. And as she heard one after
another culprit convicted of theft, poaching, shop-lifting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>burglary, or what not,—sentenced to transportation to
Botany Bay, and saw the half-brutal, half-demoniac faces
of these wretches glare on her as they passed out,—again
the vision of the convict ship, and colony, with all their
loathsome horrors, darkened around her soul, for she remembered
that the crime of which she—even <em>she</em>—stood
accused, was also a transportable offense; and convictions
seemed to be the unvarying rule of this court! And thus,
in this foul and deadly atmosphere of sin and sorrow, she
sat and sickened and despaired, until the thirteenth day,
when her case was called.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the first of June, when the sun smiled down in
cloudless beauty from the deep blue sky, upon a land green
with luxuriant vegetation, blooming and fragrant with
flowers, and vocal with the songs of birds. It was a bright,
beautiful, and glorious day; but to Estelle and her friends a
day of darkness, gloom and terror!</p>

<p class='c013'>The news that the trial would come on that morning had
been noised abroad, all over the city, and throughout the
country, and had attracted all Exeter to the court-house.</p>

<p class='c013'>As on preceding days, before leaving her lodgings, for
the court, Lady Montressor prayed long and earnestly.
And then deeply vailed, and leaning on the arm of the venerable
pastor, she came out, to enter the carriage. The
populace, who had at last discovered her lodgings and
identified her carriage, were now gathered in a dense crowd
before the hotel, waiting to see this interesting prisoner.
Short as was the distance from the portico to the coach,
and deeply vailed as was the lady, she shuddered in passing
through this crowd, whose gaze she could not see, but
keenly, deeply, <em>felt</em> fixed upon her form. Mr. Oldfield
quickly and nervously handed her into the coach, followed
her, took his seat, put up the blinds and let down the curtains;
and having thus carefully closed up the carriage,
gave orders to the coachman to drive on. They drove perforce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>slowly through the crowded streets that became more
thronged, at every square, as they approached the court-house.
When at last the coach drew up before the Hall,
Mr. Oldfield alighted, and in the same quick, nervous manner,
handed her out, and attempted to hurry her through
the crowd that thronged around, and into the court-house,
and choked up its portico, entrance hall, and staircase.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle looked wildly around upon this vast and curious
multitude. Among the carriages that blocked up the
street before the building, she recognized the liveries of
many of her former friends, and in the crowd that thronged
into the court-house, she identified many of the guests who
had been bidden to that wedding breakfast to which she had
never returned. Since that fatal day to this—perhaps
more fatal one—she had not seen or heard from one of
them! Why came they now?—to gloat over her calamities?
Who could tell? None but the Searcher of hearts;
but their presence here made <em>her</em> heart sink; true, it was a
trifle added to the great sum of her misery; but it was only
an added feather that is said to have broken the camel’s
back. These thoughts had scarcely passed through her
mind, when she saw Lord Montressor emerge from the
crowd on the portico and come down the steps to join her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A few hours more of fortitude, dear Stella, and you will
be free!” he said, as he drew her hand within his arm. He
then bowed to Mr. Oldfield, and called a police-officer, whom
he directed to precede and clear a way for them through
the crowd. And then with his fine head erect and uncovered,
and with a mien as self-possessed and dignified as
that with which he had a month ago led his bride into the
church, he now led her through the crowded portico and
passage-way, and up the staircase into the court.</p>

      <div class='line'>“She stood before the crowded court,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Forlorn—but oh! how fair!</div>
      <div class='line'>Though many a beauty graced the hall,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>To me, the loveliest there.</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On entering the thronged room, a group to the left of
the door, forced itself upon Lord Montressor’s notice. It
consisted of Victoire L’Orient, the little old French woman
and the Abbe. The woman recognized Estelle, and pressed
forward exclaiming vindictively:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, good! So that you madame—verily! Your
most obedient, madame,” etc. etc. Until, at length, without
looking at her, Lord Montressor just put out his arm
and brushed the troublesome reptile from his lady’s path,
and led her on to the same secluded seat she had daily occupied
since her attendance at court. They had not been
seated more than five minutes, before they were joined by
Lord Dazzleright, who came hurriedly to announce that
there would be no more delay than was necessary to arrange
preliminaries, and that his client would be almost immediately
placed at the bar. And then he hastened away again
to attend to some business connected with the approaching
trial.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle closed her eyes and sank back in her chair. It
had come, then, it had surely come. At the same bar at
which within a fortnight past she had seen so many stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>to answer to the charge of guilt, and from which she had
seen so many sent to exile, to imprisonment, or to death,
she also must stand to answer to the charge of crime, for
which, should she be convicted, she also, even <em>she</em> the delicate,
sensitive, refined child of wealth, luxury and high rank
would be sentenced—here again the haunting vision of the
convict transport-packet, and the penal colony, with their
brutalized or demonized crew, and all their loathsome and
revolting horrors, swam darkly in upon her brain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My God! my God! have mercy and let me die,” escaped
in stifled tones from her ashy lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle! my Estelle! be calm, be strong, be hopeful!
See they are about to call you. Call thou on Him who
once stood, as you are now about to stand, before man’s
uncertain tribunal, to be judged by man’s often erring wisdom.
Call thou on Him!” said Lord Montressor, earnestly
as he arose, took her hand, drew her arm within his own,
and attended by Mr. Oldfield, and followed by the eyes of
all the people that thronged to suffocation the court-room,
led her up to the bar, set a chair, seated her there, and
placed himself beside her. The aged minister stood on the
other side; he stooped and whispered:</p>

<p class='c013'>“When you rise, my child, do not wait for the order of
the court, but unvail at once; the innocent need not conceal
her brow of truth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The indictment was then read, and the accused was
ordered to rise and hold up her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle arose, and Lord Montressor reverentially drew
aside her vail, revealing her pale, despairing, but most
beautiful face. The crowd was behind her. Thus fortunately
she had only to confront the bench. The Judge bent
forward and looked with interest into the grief-stricken, but
lovely countenance thus unvailed before him. Under his
scrutiny, her eyes sank to the floor, and her color rose, crimsoning
her cheek even to her temples, and then receding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>left her paler than before. All this passed in an instant
And then—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Prisoner, you have heard the indictment against you
read. Are you guilty or not guilty of the crime laid to
your charge?” asked the judge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not guilty in intention, my lord,” answered the low,
thrilling voice of the accused.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may resume your seat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, with a deferential tenderness that never
failed or faltered, handed her back to her chair, and took
his stand on her right hand as before.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so perfect was the silence among the eager, attentive
crowd, that not only the questions of the Judge, but
every syllable of her low-toned reply was distinctly heard in
every part of the court-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>The multitude had now pressed as near as was permitted
to the bench, and many on either side were in a line of
vision with the accused. And among them were many of
her old associates, now gazing at her in pitiless curiosity.
Fain would she have intervened the friendly black lace vail
again between her face and the eyes of the assembly, though
in respect to her friends’ opinions she abstained from the
self indulgence; but oh! those eyes! those cruel eyes! she
felt them like a forest of leveled bayonets, pointed toward
her—impaling her.</p>

<p class='c013'>The counsel for the Crown arose, and amid the profound
silence of the court, opened the prosecution. I cannot in
my limited space give a just idea of the logic, eloquence
and power of this preliminary speech.</p>

<p class='c013'>It became his painful duty, he said, to prosecute one of
the most extraordinary cases that the annals of English
crime had ever recorded before an English tribunal. The
prisoner at the bar was known—either personally, or by
fame, to most persons there present. She had been a lady
by birth, wealth and education, holding position among the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>highest in the realm; a lady distinguished for rank and fortune,
celebrated for her exceeding beauty and accomplished
genius; <em>such she had been</em>. Now, alas! she was no less distinguished
for her discovered depravity, daring and duplicity!
They knew that she had been successful in fashionable,
aristocratic, and even in royal circles; he would now show
that she had, until recently, been equally successful in her
course of concealed guilt. He would give a synopsis of
her career, stating facts that he should prove by competent
witnesses present in this court. He should commence with
her school life, showing the gentlemen of the jury the precocious
depravity with which at the early age of fourteen
she had deceived her fond, indulgent parents, deluded her
excellent teacher, and ensnared a young gentleman into a
secret marriage, soon as lightly broken as it had been made;
the wantonness with which she had abandoned her youthful
bridegroom, driving him to despair and desperation, that
soon ended in the wreck of his fortune and character; the
duplicity with which through ten long years she had concealed
the fact of her first marriage from her parents and
friends; and the wickedness with which she had, just one
month since, entrapped the heart and hand of a noble lord
here present, and who was the second victim of this modern
Messalina!</p>

<p class='c013'>At this degrading peroration, the blood rushed to Lord
Montressor’s brow—he started forward with a flashing eye
and a raised hand—but, then recollecting himself and his
surroundings, he made a powerful effort, controlled himself,
and with the air of a man who bides his time, retreated to
his stand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle, a novice to the forms and usages of courts of
law, heard all the enormous charges, the atrocious wickedness
officially imputed to her by the prosecutor, and sat,
with pallid features and fixed stare, like a woman appalled
to marble.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>Lord Dazzleright stooped and spoke to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You should know, Lady Montressor, that this is merely
an <em>official</em> tirade, a professional affair—it means nothing,
makes no impression. The Judge don’t believe him, the
jury don’t believe him, he don’t believe himself. He is only
repeating the prosecutor’s usual raw-head and bloody bones
formula of—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Fe, faw, fum—I smell the blood of an Englishman.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>No more than just that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Estelle did not understand nor hear, nor ever once
withdraw her stony gaze, that seemed caught up and spell-bound
to the face of her terrible accuser. At length, however,
the dreadful voice ceased to declaim, and gave the
counsel for the defense an opportunity of answering. But
as Lord Dazzleright declined replying for the present, reserving
his defense, the prosecutor proceeded to call the
witnesses for the crown.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would be tedious to recapitulate the testimony, which
the reader has already heard given at the investigation before
the magistrate. The same witnesses, namely: Madame
Gabrielle L’Orient and the Abbe Pierre Le Roux, were successively
called, and testified to the same fact, to wit, that of
the marriage that had been performed between Victoire
L’Orient and Estelle Morelle at the church of St. Etienne,
Paris, on the thirteenth day of November, eighteen hundred
and ——. They also identified the prisoner at the bar and
Victoire L’Orient as the contracting parties in that ceremony.
These witnesses were in turn subjected to a severe cross-examination
by Lord Dazzleright, but without effect. The
duplicity and cunning of the little old Frenchwoman was
at least a match for the legal acumen of the best lawyer in
the three kingdoms. A host of witnesses were present,
ready to testify to the well-known fact of the so called
“felonious” marriage rites that had been celebrated on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>first day of May last, at the parish church of Hyde, in the
county of Devon, between Estelle, wife of Victoire L’Orient,
and George Charles, Lord Viscount Montressor. But a
few of these were needed to establish this point. And here
the prosecuting attorney rested his case. Lord Dazzleright
arose for the defense.</p>

<p class='c013'>All eyes were turned upon him—he was a man of distinguished
presence, as well as of brilliant genius. Amid the
deepest silence and the profoundest attention, he commenced
his speech.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Lord, and Gentlemen of the Jury:—The charge
made against my client by the learned counsel for the crown,—imposing
as it seems, and sustained as it is by competent
witnesses,—is really so unsubstantial, as to be easily overthrown,
by reference to a single fact,—as it is no doubt
<em>already</em> invalided in the estimation of your lordship, of the
jury, and of all within the sound of my voice, by the simple
<em>recollection</em> of that fact;—to wit: that the statute laws
of France as well as those of England, regard a minor of
fourteen years of age as an <em>infant</em> in the law, and incapable
of contracting marriage without the knowledge and consent
of his or her parents or guardians. Therefore, the
quasi marriage ceremony celebrated between the man Victoire
L’Orient and the infant Estelle Morelle, in the Catholic
chapel of St. Etienne, Paris, on the thirteenth day of November,
eighteen hundred and —— <em>was</em>, and <em>is</em>, completely
invalid and of none effect, and could therefore form no
obstacle to the nuptials solemnized between Estelle Morelle
and the Lord Viscount Montressor at the parish church of
Hyde on the first of May ultimo. This fact is so well
understood by all here present, that I need not dwell upon
the point any longer than to remind your lordship and the
jury that this <em>is, of itself</em>, all sufficient for the <em>legal</em> acquittal
of my client.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, my lord and gentlemen, I wish to be understood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>as standing here, <em>not only</em> in the character of an advocate
of a client,—whom I consider as having been presented and
indicted upon untenable grounds, and whom I feel assured
stands already fully acquitted before you, <em>but also</em> as the
champion of a deeply-injured and most unhappy, though
most estimable lady, whose high moral and intellectual
excellencies can only be equaled in degree by her cruel
wrongs and great sufferings,—a lady whose hand and fortune,
while yet she was an infant, became the objects of a
foul conspiracy, and whose fair name is now the target of
the sharpest arrows of calumny. My lord and gentlemen,
the proved invalidity of that first quasi marriage suffices to
clear my client before the <em>court</em>. It is, therefore, to acquit
her before the <em>tribunal of public opinion</em>, that I stand
here and proceed to make a statement of facts, every one
which I pledge myself to establish by witnesses of unquestionable
probity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Here the learned advocate commenced and gave in detail
the sorrowful history of Estelle’s school life as it is already
known to the reader. His earnestness, his eloquence and
graphic delineation of the wrongs and sufferings of the
beautiful woman who sat there waiting her doom, in death-like
stillness,—in turn flushed every cheek with indignation,
or filled every eye with tears. In the course of his speech he
said—in answer to the false and totally unfounded assumptions
of the prosecuting attorney, and to silence forever
those who from any cause might be disposed to cavil,—he
should state and prove, that, illegal as was that quasi marriage,
it had been entered upon in perfectly good faith by
his client. She supposed it valid and binding; infant as
she was, she believed herself a wife. And most wretched
as that false marriage proved, and deeply repented as it
was, <em>she</em> had remained, in every respect scrupulously faithful
to its supposed obligations. Yes, faithful not only for
the ten months that she lived and suffered under the cruel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>despotism of her <em>soi disant</em> husband, but after that,—when
the penal laws of France had sent him a convict to Algiers,
for the ten years of separation, and the two years of supposed
widowhood. She had borne her burden <em>alone</em>, until
in due course of time her betrothal to a certain noble peer,
here present, made it right and proper that she should
confide to him the fact of the previous union, then supposed
to be broken by death.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have thus given but a skeleton of Lord Dazzleright’s
address—would I could infuse into it the fullness, force, and
vitality of the original.</p>

<p class='c013'>He finished amid a breathless silence, and proceeded to
call his witnesses. They were not many, but had been selected
with the greatest care. The advocate had been very
busy during the interval of the past month, and had spared
neither time, labor, nor expense, in collecting and consolidating
testimony. He had drawn from his client’s native
county, witnesses of the very highest standing, to give
testimony upon the exemplary piety of her life and manners,
and he had dispatched a confidential agent to the Chief of
Police at Paris, to procure his assistance in hunting up the
employees who had been in the service of Madame L’Orient,
at the time of the disgraceful breaking up of her
“Pensionat,” and in selecting such as were most competent
to give evidence in this case. These were now in court,
and were successively called to the stand. Their united
testimony harmonized perfectly, and corroborated the statements
of the advocate. They were in turn severely cross-examined
by the king’s counsel; but the more their testimony
was tried, the stronger it was proved. The advocate
here rested the defense.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Judge then arose to review the case, sum up the
evidence, and charge the jury.</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship’s exposition of the law and the testimony,
in his instructions, might be considered a virtual acquittal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of the prisoner. It was like the usual charges of Sir
James Allan Parke—short, clear, and pointed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gentlemen of the Jury, you have heard the charge
upon which the prisoner at the bar stands arraigned, and
which has been clearly set forth by the counsel for the
crown, and well sustained by the witnesses he has produced.
You have also heard how that charge has been met
and answered by the counsel for the prisoner. The
fact of two marriages having taken place under the
circumstances set forth, is fully established by testimony.
The learned advocate for the accused rests his defense
upon the alleged invalidity of the first marriage. Now,
upon the validity or invalidity of that marriage, this court
has no authority to pronounce judgment, the adjudication
of such matters belongs, exclusively, to the Spiritual Court
of Arches. If the first marriage was invalid, it would
form no obstacle to the second marriage, which in such
case would not be illegal. And if, on the other hand, the
first marriage was perfectly valid, the second marriage
would be illegal; but not necessarily <em>felonious</em>. Intention
is the soul of crime. From the evidence before you, if you
find that the prisoner at the bar, upon the occasion of
solemnizing marriage with Lord Montressor, knew, or had
good and sufficient cause to believe that she had already
a husband living—it will be your duty to convict her. If,
on the other hand, you find that she knew, or had good
and sufficient reason to believe herself legally free to contract
the said marriage, it becomes your duty to acquit her.
To this single point is drawn the question. You are to
judge upon it, and render your verdict accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The Judge ceased and resumed his seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The jury retired under the conduct of the sheriff’s officer,
to another room to deliberate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the spell of breathless silence that had bound the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>spectators was dissolved. They breathed and spoke—a
buzz of voices filled the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for Estelle, she changed not from the frozen, stony
look into which she had been at first appalled by the official
abuse of the crown’s counsel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor stooped and whispered to her,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My own Estelle, courage! courage for a few moments
longer! and then all will be over; all will be well! You
are already more than acquitted, you are justified, you are
vindicated.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I know, I know all!” replied a sepulchral voice,
that Lord Montressor scarcely recognized as belonging to
his silver-tongued Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a moment, silence fell again like death upon the court-room.
It was produced by the opening of a door, and the
appearance of the bailiff, ushering in the jury. They advanced
to their place. The foreman stood before the Judge.
Not a breath was drawn, scarcely a pulse beat in that
crowded court-room for the space of a minute, during
which the Judge inquired:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon your
verdict?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have, my lord,” answered the foreman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What say you, then, is the prisoner at the bar guilty
or not guilty?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Not guilty</span>, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor is discharged from custody,” said the
Judge.</p>

<p class='c013'>A low deep murmur of satisfaction ran through the
crowd. The old minister seized the hand of his protege,
and burst into tears of joy. Lord Montressor grasped
that of Lord Dazzleright in warm acknowledgment of his
services, and congratulation of his success, and then instantly
turned to his bride.</p>

<p class='c013'>His attention was too late—she had fainted on the arm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>of the old clergyman—she who had firmly borne up under
the horrors of the past month, had now succumbed and
sunk, and lay like a statue fallen from its pedestal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor is discharged from custody,” repeated
the clerk of the court, somewhat impatiently.</p>

<p class='c013'>She looked indeed as though she were discharged not
only from the court, but from the earth—so still, so white,
so lifeless!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Raise her in your arms, Montressor: take her into the
sheriff’s room. I will show you the way,” said Lord Dazzleright,
bending anxiously over her fainting form.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this moment, also, Susan Copsewood, her maid, who
had been somewhere among the spectators, succeeded in
pushing her way through the crowd, and reaching the side
of her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor raised Estelle with care, and, preceded
by Lord Dazzleright, bore her from the court-room into
the sheriff’s office, where he laid her on the sofa, dropped
upon one knee by her side, and began to rub and chafe her
hands, and invoke her by every fond epithet and hopeful
word to awake—arise! Such restoratives as could be first
procured were brought and applied, and with such good
effect that, after a little while, a shudder passed through
her frame, her breast heaved, her face quivered—she sighed,
and opened her eyes. Her glance met the anxious, earnest
gaze of Lord Montressor bent upon her. She sighed
again, and dropped her eyelids.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stella! my Stella! my bride! my wife! rouse yourself,
dearest! You are acquitted, you are justified,” said Lord
Montressor, anxiously seeking to restore her. “You are
vindicated—you are free!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Free! free! oh God!” she cried, so despairingly, so
incoherently, with a countenance so blanched and convulsed
with anguish, that her friends drew near and gazed upon
her in as much astonishment as alarm.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>“Compose yourself, sweet Stella,” murmured Lord Montressor,
sitting down beside her, and gently smoothing away
the beautiful, dishevelled black ringlets from her cold and
clammy forehead. “Sweet love, be calm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, I am,” she said, trying to control the motions of
her quivering and ashen lips. Then gently putting aside
his caressing hand, and rising upon her elbow, she inquired:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But tell me, you, why was I acquitted, while all the
other prisoners, who had been arraigned before me, were
convicted? Did my father’s, my friends’, and my——Lord
Montressor’s rank and wealth, and power, thrown into the
scales of justice, tilt the balance in my favor? Had I only
this advantage over other wretches?” she asked, fixing her
dark eyes, querulous with suffering, upon the distressed
face of the old clergyman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, my child! This was not so. This would not
have been so, of course. English law is no respecter of
persons, and English courts are as incorruptible by wealth
as they are undismayed by power. You owe your acquittal
solely to your guiltlessness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What!” she cried, fixing her wild, dilated eyes upon
the old man’s face, “was it not <em>true</em>, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was not <em>what</em> true, my child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That which the king’s counsel said of me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not! The king’s counsel himself did not
believe the words that he spoke—his speech was a mere
official form. Compose yourself, my child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I will do so. I am composed; but hist!” she said,
sinking her voice to a whisper: “did they make me out to
be my lord’s wife?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly, my child, and you are in strict law the wife of
Lord Montressor; though the Judge of the Assizes, as
well as he knew that fact, had no authority to pronounce
upon it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh God! my God!” she cried, wringing her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>“Be calm, my child; do not let that omission distress
you, for though the Judge had no authority to give judgment
upon an affair that belonged exclusively to the ecclesiastic
courts, yet neither was his judgment needed. We
all know now, as we knew before, that you are really and
truly the wife of Lord Montressor. Have we not, ever
since your marriage, addressed you only by his name?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord! my Lord!” she cried, still twisting and wringing
her white fingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Estelle, my child, what ails you? Have you
borne up through all the trial to sink at last in the hour of
your triumph?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Triumph, was it? Oh! Lord in heaven! Lord of
pity!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle! Estelle!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You said that I was truly the wife of Lord Montressor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Undoubtedly, my child!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it was the wife of Lord Montressor who was this
day tried for——Saints in heaven! I cannot name the
charge!” She groaned, with the sweat of agony bursting
from her icy brow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle,” said Lord Montressor, now seating himself by
her side and taking her hand—“you are ill—nervous. This
is nothing new, nothing that we have not known for a
month past, why then should it distress you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, my lord! but it is! for I did not mind what they
out of pity called me! I called my lost self Estelle L’Orient!
I thought it was Estelle L’Orient who was to be tried upon
that degrading charge! And had it been Estelle L’Orient,
it had not signified! But that the wife of the Viscount
Montressor should suffer this degradation—oh! angels in
heaven! it is terrible!—it is terrible!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, you rave! pray try, for our sakes, to control
yourself, love!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But they spoke falsely—falsely! It <em>was</em> Estelle L’Orient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>who was tried for——what I cannot speak! It was
<em>Estelle L’Orient</em>, and no other! <em>Your</em> honorable name,
my lord, was never dragged down through such mire!—it
remains clear of blame!—none bearing it ever came to
shame!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not! and none have borne it more blamelessly
than my beloved Stella; but, dear one, you talk so
wildly that you had best not speak at all—come! drink
this, and then lie down and be quiet for a few minutes,” he
said, placing to her lips a glass of ice-water that had just
been brought in by her maid. She quaffed it, but instead
of lying down, she straightened her figure up, put up her
hands and pushed the overshadowing black ringlets from
her brow, and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—I will—I must control myself. There! I am
calmer now. Am I not, my friends?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—the water has done you good. You are better,
but you must rest a little while.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—let us leave this place—I shall recover sooner
without its walls.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As you please, then, love! Let your maid rearrange
your dress. Our traveling carriage waits, and the afternoon
wanes; yet before the moon rises over the hills of
Dorset, I would welcome you to your new home—Montressor
Castle,” said his lordship, affectionately busying
himself in tying her little bonnet, and tucking in her stray
ringlets.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! <em>would you</em>?—would you take Estelle to your ancestral
home, where never a dishonored woman trod before?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle! you almost anger me, love! do not talk so
insanely!” said his lordship. But she had dropped her
hands idly upon her lap, and with her gaze fastened abstractedly
upon them, had fallen into a deep reverie that
lasted several minutes, and might have lasted indefinitely
longer, had not Lord Montressor gently recalled her attention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>to the necessity of departure. She started like one
aroused from sleep—passed her hand once or twice across
her brow, and then answered in a voice, strange and unnatural
from its level monotone:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, will you please to excuse me for to-night?
I am not equal to the journey you propose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dearest, the distance is but nine miles over the
loveliest of roads, and in the easiest of carriages,” replied
his lordship, encouragingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No doubt, no doubt; yet I cannot take the road
to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well! As you please, dearest! I will then convey
you to the ‘Royal Adelaide,’ the best and quietest little
hotel in Exeter, where we can remain until you are
thoroughly rested and restored. Will that plan suit my
Stella?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You exhibit an angel’s goodness to me, my lord, and I
must tax it still further! Listen! and pray do not misconceive
me! I am not ungrateful; but—the scenes of the
last month have so severely tried me—that even now, when
I am acquitted, I cannot pass from the contemplation of the
horrors that filled my mind and threatened my future, at
once to the enjoyment of the security of your protection,
and the blessedness of your love! I need a short interval
of solitude, isolation, self-communion and prayer, before I
dare enter the Eden you open to me! Suffer me, therefore,
my dearest lord, to return, as heretofore, under the charge
of our reverend friend to my apartment at the ‘Crown and
Sceptre.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We shall meet again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may come and inquire for me, to-morrow noon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle! do you really feel this interval to be necessary
to your convenience?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>“It is vitally necessary to my <em>peace</em> and <em>sanity</em>, I think,
my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be it so, then! I cannot object, nor will I reproach
you, my Stella, cruel as I feel this delay to be. Shall I
attend you to your hotel?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you will not think me ungrateful, I prefer that you
should take leave of me, as heretofore, at my carriage
door.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! I will obey my lady’s behests, however unacceptable
they may be, and that without cavilling,” said his
lordship. “But I may come to you to-morrow, you said?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come to-morrow, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle expressed herself now ready to depart. Mr. Oldfield
arose and gave her his arm. Lord Montressor walked
by her side, and attended her into the street and to the
carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Farewell, until we meet, dear Stella,” he said, as he
placed her in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye! until we meet! Farewell, my lord,” she answered
solemnly—how solemnly he afterward remembered—lifting
her eyes to his countenance with a momentary, deep, earnest,
thrilling gaze, as though she would make and receive an
impression that should last through life!</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor lifted her hand to his lips, bowed, and
retired to give place to Mr. Oldfield, who entered the carriage,
took the seat beside Estelle, and gave orders to the
coachman to drive on.</p>

<p class='c013'>The streets were still thronged with people, waiting for
that carriage to pass, in hope of getting a sight of one whose
name, for praise or blame, was now on every tongue.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An honorable acquittal is assuredly the next worst thing
to a conviction!” thought Mr. Oldfield, as he nervously let
down the inner curtains to screen his companion from the
vulgar gaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>They finally reached their inn, the neighborhood of which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>was peopled by an expectant crowd, waiting to see their
arrival.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Oldfield wrapped her vail closely around the head of
his charge, handed her out of the carriage, and led her
quickly into the house, and up to their private parlor. As
soon as they had reached this apartment, Estelle turned to
her venerable friend, and said in a low voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Oldfield, send the servants away; I wish to have a
private conversation with you immediately.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The good clergyman complied. When they were alone,
she threw back her vail, and said in an earnest, solemn
voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Oldfield! you are a Christian minister! help me to
do my duty!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your <em>duty</em>, Lady Montressor?” repeated the clergyman,
in a perplexed, misgiving, and questioning tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye, my duty! my difficult—my dreadful duty!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I confess I do not understand you, Lady Montressor!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will explain! I must withdraw myself at once and
forever from Lord Montressor’s neighborhood and knowledge!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My child, you are certainly mad!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would I were!—but no! listen! That first marriage
of mine may not have been a <em>legal</em> obstacle; but it is, nevertheless,
an insurmountable <em>moral</em> obstacle to my union with
any other man! And oh! amid all the gloom, and terror,
and desolation of my life, I do rejoice and thank God for
one signal blessing! that I was arrested immediately, on
leaving the church, so that I lived not one moment as a
wife with Lord Montressor! and not one moment must I
so live with him! I must fly while there is yet time!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My child, my dear Estelle, you distress me beyond measure
by this rash resolution.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is not a sudden determination! Ah no! A month
ago, as soon as I recovered from the shock of my arrest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and collected my scattered faculties together, I thought of
it, pondered over it, prayed over it, and <em>decided</em> upon it—long
before the court had rendered judgment upon it. Had
I been convicted, that conviction would have virtually released
Lord Montressor. But I am acquitted, and I must
by my own act release him. I ask you as a Christian minister
to assist me in this duty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, I am very much perplexed! You are certainly in
<em>law</em> the wife of Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But not in right.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you propose to release him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By leaving the country; he will then in time forget me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He never can!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He must and will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And then——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“An act of Parliament will release him from the bond
of a merely nominal marriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The aged pastor did not reply, but sank into painful
thought, broken by occasional groans.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length, Estelle resumed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have heard my plan—will you assist me in it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Lady Montressor, I dare not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because I doubt it would be wrong to do so. It would
be treachery on my part toward Lord Montressor, whose
legal wife you are!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! would to God I were indeed his rightful wife!
Oh! would to God I were! But that I am not so—that I
cannot be so, while Victoire L’Orient lives, you, a Christian
minister, should know full well!” cried Estelle, passionately.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor, I consider your conscience morbid
upon this subject. Monsieur Victoire L’Orient has not the
shadow of a claim to your hand. You never were his
wife!” said the minister solemnly.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Estelle grew paler than ever she had been before, and
fixing her eyes steadily upon the face of her venerable friend,
she slowly inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if, as you say, I never was the wife of Victoire
L’Orient—<em>what then was I to him</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The good old pastor winced and fidgetted, but at last
replied—</p>

<p class='c013'>“His innocent victim!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘His innocent victim!’ And think you, then, that this
‘victim’ of Monsieur Victoire L’Orient is a fit and proper
consort for the Right Honorable, the Viscount Montressor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, his lordship thinks so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Slowly and sadly Estelle shook her head—</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Mr. Oldfield! he is a moral hero—and he loves the
poor woman before you. He would risk name, rank, and
social influence—every thing, save true honor, to rescue her
from the slough of despond into which she has fallen. He
would be the Curtius to throw himself into the yawning
abyss opened in my life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor, you are wrong upon this subject!
You accuse yourself too bitterly. Reflect! your sole error
in this affair was a thoughtless disregard of your filial relations.
Even that fault, I am constrained to say, was very
much palliated by the circumstances in which you were
placed—from earliest infancy under the sole charge and
absolute rule of an artful and unscrupulous woman. You
were the victim, I repeat, of a pair of accomplished
villains—mother and son. As far as your part in that
<em>quasi</em> marriage went, you acted in good faith, you believed
the proceeding to be a lawful one. If that marriage was
illegal and has been vacated, you are not to be blamed; the
fault was not yours. History and biography record many
cases in which, under like circumstances, the marriage even
of kings and queens have been dissolved, or rather pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>invalid from the beginning, and the parties have
been left free to contract second matrimonial engagements.
Lord Montressor, I am sure, takes this view of the subject.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again and more mournfully Estelle shook her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Mr. Oldfield! My lord thinks only of me—but
I—I think of <em>him</em>, and of what he will have to bear for my
sake!” Then breaking into passionate sorrow, she exclaimed—“Once,
and long before he ever had the misfortune
to look upon this fatal face of mine—wherever he
appeared, his presence spread a certain festive gladness, like
the coming of a hero or the shining of the sun! ‘That
is <span class='sc'>Lord Montressor</span>,’ would cry one exulting voice!
‘Where?’ would question a dozen eager tones and glances!
‘There! there! that tall man, with the kingly brow and
saintly smile! That is he! you cannot mistake him!’ would
reply those who knew his person. For every one knew his
<em>name</em>. And <em>then</em> all eyes turned upon him in admiration
and worship!—But <em>now!</em> but <em>now!</em> how different, oh my
God! Listen what he may have to bear and I may have
to hear! We go into public—into church, festive hall or
mart,—it does not matter which!—some busybody, who
knows his face whispers ‘That is Lord Montressor.’ ‘What!
he who married that woman who was tried before the Assizes?’
asks one. ‘What! he who took away another man’s
bride?’ inquires another. (For so many will view it! So
soon are good deeds forgotten, so little it requires to distort
facts, and take away an honorable man’s good name.)
But no! no! no! no! they shall not have this thing to say
of my lord!—of my dear, dear and honored lord! whose
name shall shine unclouded among the stars!—for whose
good and happiness I would willingly become——what
would I <em>not</em> become? The dust of the earth that all men
trample—if that could raise <em>him</em> higher, or make him happier!
I will go away, far away, he shall not know whither!
He shall never hear of me again! I shall be dead to him!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>An act of Parliament will set him free from the bond of our
nominal union. Then the most that the bitterest caviller
can say, will be—‘That is Lord Montressor who married
Miss Morelle, that was tried at Exeter! Happily he
divorced her, before the marriage was consummated.’ In
time the caviller will forget to say even so much; as in
time Lord Montressor will also forget his lost Estelle, and
be happy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Happy? he! Lord Montressor! My child, from my
own observations of the past month, I feel assured that
Lord Montressor will never find happiness in forgetfulness
of you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He must and shall! I will, in my retirement, besiege
Heaven with prayers for his peace! Did ever a woman
wear out her days and nights with prayers that the husband
whom she loves, may cease to love and may forget her?
So will I pray, and so shall my lord find peace! But we
lose precious time! Say! will you aid me to leave this
place secretly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not, Lady Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And is this your ultimatum?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Absolutely, Lady Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Oldfield! are you then a Christian minister, or are
you only the incumbent of Bloomingdale?” asked the lady,
in sorrowful bitterness of spirit.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I humbly trust that I am a Christian minister; but not
therefore a fanatic, Lady Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And do you think it a Christian act to refuse to aid me
in my conscientious withdrawal from Lord Montressor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I take the part of law and order, my lady, and such I
think the duty of every Christian.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I—take the part of God and—war, if need be—choose
martyrdom if need be! Good-night, <em>most Christian
minister</em>!” said Lady Montressor, rising to leave the
room.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Good-night, my child. You are sarcastic; but I do
not deserve it. You will sleep on this; and to-morrow
you will think better of it and me. God bless and comfort
you, my child. Good-night,” said the old man, very
mildly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle smiled mournfully, ironically, as she passed to the
door; but while her hand rested upon the lock, her heart
relented—repented—she turned back, went to the side of
her venerable friend, took his aged hand, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive my unkind words. Trouble makes me irritable
and unjust—yes! and ungrateful! For you have been
very good to me; when my father and my mother forsook
me, <em>you</em> took me up; when I stood arraigned upon a criminal
and degrading charge, <em>you</em> stood at my side, sustaining
me. Do you think that I can ever forget, or be thankless
to you? Oh, never! no! God bless and preserve
you! God love you and reward you! Good-night!
<em>Good-night!</em>” she cried, and pressed his hand fervently to
her heart and lips—then dropped it, turned, and hurried
from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>The good clergyman never looked upon her living face
again.</p>

<p class='c006'>When Lady Montressor reached her own apartment, she
found her faithful attendant, Susan Copsewood, kneeling
among the trunks, in the middle of the floor, busily engaged
in packing them.</p>

<p class='c013'>On hearing the door opened Susan arose from her knees
to receive and attend upon her mistress; but started and
stood aghast on beholding the wild and haggard countenance
of the lady. True, she had often seen that beauteous
countenance darkened with the midnight of despair, or
convulsed with a storm of passionate sorrow; and so she
had no right to be amazed at any of its tempestuous
changes; but she had never seen any thing like this—this
half-insane, death-like look!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven and earth, my lady! what is it? What new
misfortune? What can I do for you? Sit down, dear
Madam—here!” she exclaimed, recovering her presence of
mind sufficiently to enable her to draw forward an easy
chair and place her mistress in it. Lady Montressor sank
down into the seat and dropped her face upon her open
hands, while her vail of long, black ringlets fell forward
concealing them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Lady—dear lady! What is the matter? What can I
do for you?” pleaded Susan, kneeling by her mistress’s side
and looking up imploringly to her hidden face—“dear,
dear lady, what can I do for you?—what is it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! nothing, nothing, Susan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive me, dear Madam, but you always say that!
And this is not just <em>nothing</em>!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dearest mistress!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think you <em>love</em> me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think the sun <em>warms</em> you, dear lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I know you are <em>faithful</em> to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I were half as faithful to the Lord, I should be sure
of Heaven, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush! speak lower. Go and see if the passage is
clear, and then lock the door.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan obeyed, and then returned and kneeled down by
her mistress’s side.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor dropped her hands from her agonized
face, and looked down deeply into the honest, affectionate
eyes that were lifted so imploringly to hers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, I <em>know</em> you will be worthy of the great trust I
am about to repose in you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try me, Madam! try me! if it is a secret, they might
put me on an old-time rack and wrench and screw my limbs
until their own limbs ached with the labor, and they’d never
screw any thing out of my lips that was put into my heart
by your ladyship!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do believe you speak sincerely; but your fidelity will
not be put to so severe a test, Susan,” said Lady Montressor.
Then, after a thoughtful pause, during which she sat with
her head resting wearily on her hand, and her eyes fixed
upon the floor, she suddenly looked up and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, I must go to London to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam! My lady!” exclaimed the girl in consternation.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“I must depart in secret, and alone,” continued Lady
Montressor, while Susan gazed with no abatement of surprise
and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>You</em> will, therefore, have to make all necessary arrangements
for me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, Madam—but, my dearest mistress——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be silent, dear girl, or rather listen to me, and answer
my questions. When does the Bristol train go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At twelve to-night, and at six in the morning, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must go by the night train. How far is the depot
from this house, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At least a mile, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What o’clock is it now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has just struck eight, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No later? good! We can complete all necessary arrangements
in three hours, and I can leave here by eleven
and reach the depot in time. Go now, dear girl, and engage
a hackney-coach to be in readiness.—No! that would
never do—that would betray me. I must walk the distance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear, dear lady, you could never walk it—never!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I am able. I shall walk,” said Lady Montressor,
so calmly and resolutely, that her maid dared not pursue
the argument; but looking at her mistress through eyes
obscured with tears, she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear, dear lady, you keep on saying ‘I,’ and ‘I,’ ‘I
can leave,’ and ‘I shall walk,’ as if—as if—as if—oh!——”
cried Susan, suddenly breaking down and sobbing aloud.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her mistress gazed upon her in calm surprise, while she
sobbed and caught her breath, and sobbed again, struggling
through the fit into composure. Then when the girl, with
a few ebbing, little sobs, wiped her eyes, Lady Montressor
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now then, Susan, why do you grieve?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The question nearly set Susan off again, but she valiantly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>slaughtered a sob with a hiccough, and answered, rather
accusatively, by saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You keep on repeating ‘I’ and ‘I’ as if—as if—you
were going to leave me behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What! do you wish to go with me, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I am about to leave England—to leave all my
past, easy and pleasant life behind, and to go into retirement
in some foreign country.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my lady! what have I done to deserve to be cast
off and left behind?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing ill, have you done, my dear girl! but do you
really wish to leave your native country, your home and
friends, and attach yourself to the doubtful fortunes of a
hapless fugitive like your mistress?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, I have neither father nor mother—nor any
one to love and serve but <em>you</em>——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will leave a letter with you for Mr. Oldfield, who will
procure you a better home than I could ever give you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It isn’t <em>that</em>,” said Susan, with a certain quiet self-respect.
“I would get homes enough, dear lady; but——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish to go with <em>you</em>. I love you, my lady. I would
follow you to the world’s end!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you follow me, it may even be to that extent, dear
girl!” said Lady Montressor, extending her hand to Susan,
who caught and covered it with kisses.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I may go, your ladyship?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is only for your own sake I hesitate, to say—yes,
Susan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The girl chose to hear only the two last words of Lady
Montressor’s reply, and arose with alacrity to wait her next
orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may put up a change of clothing in a small packet—that
will be sufficient for me. The trunks must be left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>here for the present—to take them with us would be to
blazon our journey. By the way, how came they all open,
and in the middle of the floor?” said Lady Montressor,
noticing for the first time the confusion of the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon, my lady. But when we were leaving the court-room,
his lordship—Lord Montressor I mean, said to me—‘Susan,
my good child, hasten home and pack your lady’s
trunks before she shall have time to get there, so that she
shall not be incommoded and fatigued by the confusion.’
And I was doing it, your ladyship, not expecting you in so
soon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, the dear! the kind! the ever-thoughtful! Oh, <em>my
lord! my lord!</em>” murmured Estelle in low, inaudible, heart-broken
tones, as this little instance of Lord Montressor’s
ever-considerate love touched her heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, you are not well! You have taken no rest
and no refreshment since morning. Let me undress you;
lie down and rest, while I go and order something for
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot! Oh, I cannot, Susan!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Lady Montressor——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not teaze me, dear girl! I can neither eat nor sleep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But how then will your ladyship have strength to reach
the cars?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Truly! that is well put! I thank you, Susan, for
reminding me. Well, well, if I must take something, go
order a cup of coffee, it will be sufficient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And, dear lady, won’t you lie down and sleep, while I
go and have it prepared?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well, my girl, to please you I will lie down,
whether I can sleep or not,” replied Lady Montressor, who
then arose and permitted her maid to loosen her dress and
arrange her comfortably upon the couch where she laid
down, but not to <em>sleep!</em> not even to <em>rest!</em> There was no
rest for that tempest-tost soul.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Susan closed the blinds, let down the curtains, and having
thus darkened the chamber, stole out to do her errand.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lady Montressor, after many hours of excitement,
found herself in the calm of solitude. Alone! but alone
with her heart! alone with her Tempter! She had thought
the moral struggle over, the victory won, the Tempter fled!
But ah! no sooner did she find herself thus alone, than the
Evil spirit, in his fairest guise, reappeared to her, beset her,
arrayed before her tearless, burning eyes and bleeding heart,
the loveliness of the life she was leaving, the desolation of
the doom to which she was departing! Ah! how difficult,
how cruel, how insupportable the duty, to turn away from
native country, from home, from friends, and more than all
from <em>him</em>—from <em>him</em>, and go out sorrowing, alone and exposed,
into the wide, bleak, dreary, desolate world! It
was like going into the “outer darkness” spoken of in the
Scriptures! To go far away, out of his knowledge, and
out of his reach! never again to meet his dear familiar eyes
and smile! never again to hear one tone of his beloved
voice! never to expect his coming or listen for his step!
never to get a letter from him and never to write one!
never to hear of him again in the whole course of her life!—never!
never! How insufferable, while yet living, thus
to die away from his knowledge, to die to him! It was
like being buried alive! like going with her warm young
blood, and loving heart, and thinking brain, down, down
into the grave, to be smothered under the stifling clods of
the earth!</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot do it! I cannot! Oh, God! it is too much!
too much!” she cried, wringing her pale fingers in the extremity
of anguish. The Tempter, ever watchful to take
advantage of our weakest moment, whispered—That she
need not do it! that she was not required thus to immolate
her rich, warm young life! to leave <em>him</em> bereaved! She
was free to love him forever! for was he not her legal husband?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>She could fold her spirit’s bruised and weary wings
and nestle down sweetly into his home and heart, held open
to enfold her! The temptation was invincible, irresistible!
it drew her soul onward with a mighty magnetism.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I faint—I yield—Oh, God! my God! come to aid! save,
or I perish!” she cried, and suddenly lost all consciousness!</p>

<p class='c013'>A strange vision passed before her spirit. She was in
the heart of a vast and dense forest whose tall, dark trees
encircled and nodded over the banks of a lake of crystal
clearness and unfathomable depth. She stood, frightened,
and despairing, she knew not wherefore, until looking
down into the dark, transparent waters, she beheld her husband,
Lord Montressor, sinking, drowning! With a cry of
desolation, she was about to cast herself into the lake,
when she felt herself gently held back, and looking over
her shoulder, she beheld a man of celestial presence, arrayed
in flowing white garments, standing behind her, holding
her by his left hand, while his right hand was lifted toward
Heaven in a gesture of supreme majesty! Full of awe
her gaze followed his index, and she beheld high in the
Heavens, the ascending form of her husband. And so she
understood that it was but the <em>reflected image</em> of the
ascending form, that she had mistaken for her husband
sinking in the water! “And thus,” said the celestial Mentor—“the
apparent perishing of the beautiful hopes of earth
is but the inverted reflection of their translation to
Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With this vision before her, with this voice in her ears,
she gently opened her eyes—restored to full consciousness.
How quiet after the tempest of emotion, was now her soul,
how patient her spirit—how short and unreal, mortal and
visible life seemed; how real and eternal the invisible and
spiritual! Her whole being was calmed, and strengthened
and elevated. Her first waking thoughts were prayers for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>courage, for fortitude! for oh! withal she needed a martyr’s
firmness and heroism, to persevere and tread unflinchingly
the dread path of duty she had chosen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently her maid stole in on tip-toe, and cautiously
approached the couch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am not sleeping, Susan, child. You may ring and
order lights,” the lady said.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan obeyed. And when lights were brought and
Susan could see her mistress’s face,—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are better, my lady,” she said, cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am better, Susan,” replied Lady Montressor, rising
and suffering her attendant to bathe her face and hands,
and comb her hair and arrange her dress. When these
toilet services were rendered, the maid rang again and was
answered by the waiter, who made his appearance with a
tray of refreshments for Lady Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan placed a sofa-table beside the couch upon which
her ladyship reclined, arranged the viands upon it, and
pressed her mistress to partake of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor forced herself to swallow a piece of
bread and a few mouthfuls of coffee. Then pushing the
salver from her, she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“There! take these things away, my girl, and go and get
your supper, while I write two letters that must be left
behind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan did as she was ordered.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lady Montressor when left alone, went and sat
down at her writing-table, and wrote—first, a short note
of adieu, which she folded and directed to Mr. Oldfield.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she commenced a farewell letter to Lord Montressor.
She poured out her whole heart and soul freely upon that
paper!—page after page, sheet after sheet, was filled as her
pen flew along the lines; her undying love, her terrible
temptation, her agonizing struggle, her final, despairing renunciation—all,
all, was poured forth with the living eloquence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>of a loving, despairing, impassioned heart! At last
she paused, exhausted, and laid down her pen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Had she finished? Had she poured forth all her burning
brain thought?—all her bleeding heart felt?</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah, no!—not a millionth part! And yet she had said
too much! too much!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Alas! how inconsistent I am! how weak,” she said; “I
practice self-denial at one point, and fall into self indulgence
at another! Why, to write <em>thus</em>, <em>to him</em>, is almost
as wrong as to remain and live with him! For, oh! if I
should send him this letter, showing him how much I love
and suffer and despair, he will never resign me, never free
himself and forget me and be happy! No, no, he would
search for me over the world, and not finding me, would
sit down in his ‘chamber of desolation’ to mourn me forever!
That must not be! He must not know the anguish
of this bosom. I must drink this cup of renunciation to the
dregs, denying my heart even the sorrowful consolation of
writing to him;—save, perhaps, a few lines of friendly
leave-taking.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She tore up her first and impassioned letter, and then she
took a sheet of paper and wrote a short note of adieu, which
she folded and directed.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few minutes after this her maid returned to the room,
and announced that her few preparations were complete,
and that it was near eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are <em>you</em> ready, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam,” replied the girl, tying on her bonnet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is the house quiet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our portion of it is, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, then. Now give me my cottage bonnet and
shawl.—Thank you. Now my thick vail and my gloves.—That
is right. Have you the packet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are ready, then, I believe?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>“Yes, my lady,” replied Susan; but still she lingered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, then, why do you loiter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive me, dear lady! but I knew you could not walk;
besides, it is coming on to rain hard; so I took the liberty
of going out and engaging a cab, that is to wait for us at
the corner of the next square. Pray do not be uneasy,
dear lady; the cabman knows nothing, but that he is to
take two passengers to the cars.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, well, my girl! you acted for the best, and I do
not blame you, but thank you; and trust that your act may
not lead to a premature discovery of our flight. Come, let
us go,” said Lady Montressor, and she placed the two letters
in a conspicuous position on the mantle-piece, while Susan
extinguished the lights.</p>

<p class='c013'>They then left the chamber; Susan closed the door after
them. And so Lady Montressor, attended by her faithful
servant, went down the stairs, through the long passage,
and out by the private door—out into the double darkness
of the midnight and the tempest!</p>

<p class='c006'>Lord Montressor arose early next morning, and devoted
the whole forenoon to engaging a pleasant suite of rooms
at the “Royal Adelaide,” and in superintending their arrangement
for the reception of his bride. The apartments
were quite ready by eleven o’clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>And a few minutes before twelve, Lord Montressor entered
his carriage, and drove to the  “Crown and Sceptre,”
to keep his appointment with Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>He inquired for Lady Montressor, and was shown up at
once into her private parlor, while the waiter took his card
up to her ladyship’s chamber. He waited impatiently for
a few moments until the servant returned, with the information
that neither Lady Montressor nor her woman was in
her ladyship’s room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is strange,” thought Lord Montressor. “Take
this card up to Mr. Oldfield, and let him know that I would
be happy to see him in this room,” he said, handing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>“pasteboard” to the waiter. The man received it and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no suspicion nor misgiving in the impatience
with which Lord Montressor waited for the appearance of
Mr. Oldfield. He simply thought it unusual that Lady
Montressor should not be ready to receive him, and wished
to inquire for her of the minister. Presently the door
opened, and Mr. Oldfield entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! how do you do, my dear friend? I hope Lady
Montressor is well this morning?” said his lordship, advancing
to meet the pastor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope so too, but Lady Montressor has not made her
appearance to-day,” said Mr. Oldfield.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed! and it is now,” said his lordship, consulting
the mantle clock, “half-past twelve.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her ladyship sometimes breakfasts and spends her
mornings in her chamber, and as she was very much fatigued
last night, probably she prefers to keep her own
room to-day. Sit down, my lord! sit down! do not stand,”
said the minister, handing a chair to his visitor and seating
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, my dear sir, I sent up my card, and neither Lady
Montressor nor her attendant is in her ladyship’s apartment.
I had hoped that my lady was with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; no, no; I have seen neither Lady Montressor nor
her maid this morning,” said Mr. Oldfield, beginning to feel
a vague uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is a little unusual, is it not?” inquired his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh?—yes! it <em>is</em>, my lord! <em>Very</em> unusual! I—think
I will go up and see if—any thing is the matter!” gasped
the old man in a great accession of uneasiness, as he hurriedly
left the room to go in search of his charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, being left alone, paced up and down
the parlor floor until he was startled by the violent throwing
open of the door, and the impetuous entrance of Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Oldfield, who pale and agitated held out two letters—one
sealed, the other open and fluttering in his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What! what is the matter? Estelle! my Estelle! Is
she ill? Has any thing happened to her? In the name of
Heaven speak, Mr. Oldfield! What of my Estelle?” exclaimed
Lord Montressor, stricken with a panic of anxiety.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone! my lord! She is gone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Gone!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone! Fled!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Fled!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fled, my lord! Fled alone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the name of Heaven, my friend, what mean you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! sir! read and see!” exclaimed the old man,
thrusting the two letters into the hands of his companion,
and sinking into a chair, and wiping the drops of cold perspiration
from his forehead.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor seized the billets, and naturally read the
open one first. It was addressed to Mr. Oldfield, and was
as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Dear and Honored Friend</span>:—Duty constrains me to
depart. And though your heart so pleads for the temporal
happiness of your ‘child,’ as almost now to drown the
voice of conscience, yet on calm, dispassionate reflection,
you will see that it is so. Farewell! Be Heaven as kind
to you, as you have been to the poor</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Estelle</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>With a heavy groan, Lord Montressor threw this note
aside, and tore open and devoured the contents of the
other, which was addressed to himself. It was written as
coolly as she in her self-denial had ordained it to be:</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>My Lord</span>:—Conscience compels me to withdraw from
you. Only to avoid hindrance I go secretly. An Act of
Parliament will free you from the bond of our merely nominal
marriage. Farewell, my Lord! May you be happy
with a happier woman than the lost</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><span class='sc'>Estelle</span>.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“What does all this mean? When did she go? Where
has she gone? <em>How</em> has she gone? What friends has she?
What means? Answer, in the name of Heaven, sir, if
you can!” exclaimed Lord Montressor, in extreme agitation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, my lord, I do not know. I cannot tell. How
should I? Except—yes! give me time!” cried the old
man, wiping the beaded drops from his forehead, and struggling
to regain composure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir? Well?” exclaimed Lord Montressor, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! Well, when did she go, you ask? Stay! let me
collect myself and think—yes, she certainly last night spoke
of going,” said the old man somewhat incoherently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Last night she spoke of going, and you did not warn me?
Oh, Mr. Oldfield!” exclaimed his lordship, reproachfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, she only <em>spoke</em> of going, and invoked my
assistance. I refused to aid her, and endeavored to persuade
her from her purpose. Had I suspected she was
about to depart, I should at once have summoned your
lordship. But who could have foreseen that she would
have left us in this sudden manner?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She spoke last night of going! Inform me, sir, if you
please, and as nearly as you can recollect, <em>all</em> that passed
last night upon that subject.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will endeavor to comply, my lord,” said the clergyman,
who then commenced and related the conversation
that had taken place between himself and Lady Montressor
in that parlor on the evening previous.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir, did she drop no hint as to <em>whither</em> she intended to
go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not a word, not a breath, my lord!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unhappy girl! Oh Estelle! Estelle! whom I would
have gathered into my bosom, safe from all the storms of
life! where are you now? Oh! Estelle, Estelle!” he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>groaned, burying his face in his hands. In another moment
he started up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We waste time, Mr. Oldfield. Show me into her room.
Perhaps there, some clue may be found to her flight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a deep sigh the aged minister nodded assent, and
preceded his friend up the stairs, and into the deserted
chamber lately occupied by Lady Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, who had by this time recovered his
presence of mind, calmly and collectedly went about the
business of investigation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The bed has not been occupied; she did not therefore
sleep here. But the couch is pressed; she must have laid
down to rest. Let me see: here are the sperm candles,
half burned down; she must have passed some hours of the
night here. Her trunks are here; therefore she must have
preferred to go out very quietly, and without calling assistance,”
he said, going about the room, and making his observations.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my lord! ring the bell! summon the people of the
inn, and question them,” said the old clergyman, eagerly
moving toward the bell-rope.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stay—do not ring yet; to examine these people should
be our last resort; from appearances here, and from other
circumstances, I doubt if they know any thing about her
flight. And if they do not, I prefer not to enlighten them.
Let us go down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They left the room, locking the door, and withdrawing
the key.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they had reached the parlor, Lord Montressor said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Make no stir; create no excitement; leave the people
of the inn to suppose, as they naturally will do, that Lady
Montressor has left with your knowledge and consent. I
will tell you how we may manage, without exciting their
suspicion, to get information from them. Ring, and call
for your bill up to this present hour, as if you were about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>to leave, which I suppose you will do in the course of the
day. When the account is presented, note its <em>last items</em>.
See if there is supper, a post-chaise, a messenger, or a
porter, charged last night for Lady Montressor. If so,
you can cavil at these items, and so, by disputing a little,
get the whole facts, as far as they may be known here—whether
she took supper, whether she procured a conveyance
from the house, at what hour she went, and whither—and
all without attracting particular attention.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see, I see,” exclaimed the old man, pulling the bell-rope
so vigorously that it was speedily answered by a
waiter, who was directed to bring up Mr. Oldfield’s account.</p>

<p class='c013'>When, a few minutes after, the man reappeared, and
presented the bill, Mr. Oldfield took it and glanced down
its columns: supper for Lady Montressor was the last item.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum-m—hum-m—hum-m” said the old gentleman, in
the tone of one taking exception—“I think there is some
mistake here; I think her ladyship did not take supper.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, please your reverence, I carried it up,” replied
the waiter.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum-m—it must have been very late when you carried
it up—as you say,” said Mr. Oldfield, with the manner of
a man who won’t be imposed upon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, please zir—at ten o’clock,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hum-m. You have not charged the post-chaise, I see!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There wasn’t no po’shay ordered, for no one here,
please zir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, yes, I—you are right—(the old man was about to
say, “I <em>recollect</em>—you are right,” but arrested himself before
telling an untruth)—yes, you are right! Lady Montressor
went away in a cab.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A few more adroitly put questions resulted in nothing
satisfactory. The bill was paid, and the waiter, with a
small donation, dismissed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She <em>must</em> have gone away in a cab, you know; so I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>told no untruth about <em>that</em>,” said Mr. Oldfield, uneasy upon
the subject of his little duplicity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“These, then, are the facts as far as we know them—simply,
that she took supper, rested awhile, wrote a letter,
and, attended by her maid, left the house after ten o’clock.
Now, the question is, <em>Whither</em> did she go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old minister mournfully shook his head. He could
make no suggestion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think,” continued Lord Montressor, notwithstanding
his great anxiety, calmly reasoning out the matter, “judging
from all you told me, that she meant to leave England;
to do this she must have gone to Liverpool or to London.
The night train for London and Liverpool leaves at twelve
o’clock. I think she went by that train. The grand junction
is at Bristol. So far, I think, we have her. But at
Bristol—did she take the London or the Liverpool route?
Have you any knowledge to throw light upon this subject?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The clergyman shook his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has she <em>friends</em> at either of these places?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again the old man shook his head, with a mournful wave
of the hand, saying,</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Once</em>, my lord, <em>many</em>. <em>Now</em>, I doubt, <em>any</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My God! what will become of her! so delicate, so
fragile, so sorrowful, so inexperienced—alone, and unfriended
in this bitter world! Oh! Estelle! my Estelle!
But I must not think of these things! to do so will unfit
me for action. Tell me, sir—has she means?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man groaned—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, her father, when he sent her wardrobe, sent
also a check for a thousand pounds. She placed the latter
in my hands for our current expenses. I drew the money
for it; but never could prevail on her to receive back a
shilling of it. It remains untouched in my possession yet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then she has no funds at all! My Estelle! Oh!
what will become of you!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>“Let me reflect—yes, she <em>has</em> funds; she has a small
competency in her own right; five thousand pounds left
her by her grandmother; it is in the hands of a banker in
London.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then she has gone to London to draw it before leaving
England. I may overtake and recover her yet! Oh! if
I had known this precious fact three hours ago, I might
then have gone after her by the noon train, and have been
only twelve hours behind her. As it is, I must now wait
for the midnight cars, and be a full day behind! Oh,
Heaven! how difficult to govern one’s impatience and be
calm in a forced inaction under such circumstances! But
patience. I shall see her soon: all will be well. What is
the name of the banker who has her funds?” inquired his
lordship, taking out his tablets.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Scofield Brothers, Lombard street, London.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-afternoon, sir. I am going to pack up for my
journey,” said Lord Montressor, rising, and returning the
memorandum to his pocket.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-day, my lord. I would myself accompany you
on this journey, but that my parishioners are in sad want
of their truant pastor, and my old wife is impatient to see
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it, I know it: it must be so—good-bye, sir.
You have my everlasting gratitude for your kindness to
Lady Montressor. Good-bye.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stay one moment, my dear lord! You know the tenor
of her note. Suppose when you find her, she still refuses
to return with you? Excuse my question, for the sake of
anxiety.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Should she still refuse—I should give her time, use
reason, persuasion, prayer: should not these avail, I should
then use <em>my power</em>. I should compel Estelle to return
with me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Yes, I repeat it. She shall not sacrifice herself to
fanaticism. I will constrain my love to come home and be
at peace?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus the two gentlemen parted: Mr. Oldfield to prepare
for his return to his pastoral charge, Lord Montressor to
make arrangements for his journey to London.</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship was at the depot in full time. The train
started at twelve. Swiftly as he was carried forward, this
seemed the longest ride and the longest night he had ever
known. Some minutes less than two hours brought him to
Bristol and the Grand Junction, where half an hour served
for change of cars; and thus at half-past three o’clock, he
found himself whirled along through night, and mist, and
rain, on the route toward London. Soon the morning
dawned and reddened in the east behind what seemed a
bank of cloud; it was the mingled mist and fog that overhung
the leviathan of cities.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cars entered London from the West and reached the
depot just as the sun arose. Lord Montressor took a hackney-coach
and drove to a hotel in the immediate neighborhood
of Lombard street. As it was now very early, some
hours had yet to be lived through before he could hope to
find the bankers at their place of business. He ordered
an apartment, and got through the time as well as he could
by making his morning toilet and attempting his morning meal.
Directly after breakfast, he entered a carriage and
drove to the banking-house of Scofield Brothers. He inquired
for either of the owners, and was ushered into a
back office where the junior partner sat writing at a desk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, sir,” said Lord Montressor, advancing—“You
are——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“John Scofield, at your service,” answered the banker,
rising.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Happy to see you, my lord. Pray be seated”—handing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>a chair. “Hope we may be able to serve you this morning?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor looked for an instant into the honest
face of the banker, and then with the air of a man who
states a fact known to himself, rather than one who asks
information upon a subject, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor was with you yesterday?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And withdrew her deposits, of course?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She did, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor paused. How to frame his next inquiry
as to the whereabouts of Estelle, without exciting the
astonishment and conjecture of the man to whom he spoke,
was now the difficulty. However, the question must be
put. Lord Montressor was not one to shrink; besides,
what indeed was the importance of Mr. John Scofield’s
surmises and speculations to Lord Montressor?</p>

<p class='c013'>“Favor me with Lady Montressor’s London address, if
you please, sir,” said his lordship, quietly.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was not with surprise nor wonder, but with simple consternation,
that the banker stood dumbfounded!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you hear my question, Mr. Scofield?” asked Lord
Montressor, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg pardon, my lord,” said the banker, in a tone and
manner in which astonishment was modified by respect;
“but I am unable to furnish you with her ladyship’s address.
Lady Montressor has left England.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was an overwhelming annunciation! Yet Lord Montressor
neither started nor exclaimed; he was a man of too
much firmness and self-control to do either, and perhaps
also he had been too well prepared for it by what had preceded
it; yet it was a stunning blow; he felt it so; he
looked again and steadily, almost with rude scrutiny, into
the face of John Scofield. Yes, he thought he could trust
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>that face and confide in the rectitude and discretion of that
man;—he knew also that the banker could not be really
ignorant of the great trial lately concluded at the Exeter
Assizes;—for the rest he must have faith in him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you favor me with a few moments of private conversation,
Mr. Scofield?” he inquired in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, my lord,” replied the banker, dismissing his
clerk, and closing and locking the door behind him. “Now,
my lord, I am at your service,” he concluded, returning and
resuming his seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are of course aware, Mr. Scofield, of the painful
scenes through which Lady Montressor—and myself,” (he
added in that affectionate and generous spirit in which he
ever wished to associate <em>himself</em> in all that was distressing
and humiliating in her life,)—“have lately passed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am aware, my lord,” replied the banker, gravely and
respectfully dropping his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you do not know, perhaps, that Lady Montressor
and myself have not passed one single moment alone together
since our marriage; or that notwithstanding the perfect
legality of the ceremony that binds us together, Lady
Montressor considers it her Christian duty to reserve herself
from my protection; and in order to do so effectually,
has withdrawn herself from my knowledge. Now, I would
know whither she has gone, if you, without a breach of confidence,
can inform me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The banker who had listened in respectful sympathy to
the words of Lord Montressor, now paused and reflected
before answering—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, as Lady Montressor, of course, made no confidential
communications to us, I do not know that any
reason exists why I should not give you all the information
upon this subject in my power.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will thank you then, sir, to proceed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The manner in which I learned that Lady Montressor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>was about to leave England was merely incidental, as my
knowledge of her destination, is, I may say, barely inferential.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Proceed, sir, proceed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her ladyship came, early yesterday morning—much
about this time, in fact,—to withdraw the funds she had in
our hands. She required a portion of them in cash and the
remainder in drafts upon some American house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then she has gone to America!” interrupted Lord
Montressor, recollecting at that trying moment the fervent
admiration with which poor Estelle had often spoken of the
young Western Republic.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Undoubtedly, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on, sir! pray, go on—when did she sail? Her
voyage must have been very sudden! She must have
chanced upon a ship about to leave port.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think that quite likely, my lord. When she was
about to leave us, she required that the money and drafts
should be sent down to her at the Nelson’s Head before
eleven o’clock, as she should leave the hotel at that hour.
We had correspondents in New York and in Baltimore. I
inquired of her ladyship upon which of these the drafts
in her favor should be drawn, and she said—upon the
Baltimore house. The money was sent in due season. Our
clerk, who was intrusted with its delivery, saw Lady Montressor
leave the hotel at eleven o’clock. And we know that
the Princess, Captain Caton, sailed from this port at twelve,
bound for Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we are to infer that she went to Baltimore, though
the fact wants confirmation. One piece of information more,
sir,—the name of your Baltimore correspondents?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sommerville and Son, Pratt street.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you happen to know, sir, when the next vessel sails
for the United States?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Then I thank you for the assistance you have already
given me. Good-morning, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, my lord. If we can be so happy as to
serve your lordship in any capacity, pray consider us always
at your orders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, sir. Good-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And thus the peer and the banker parted.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heaven! how very matured her plans must have
been, and with what dispatch she must have carried them
out!” thought Lord Montressor, as he left the banking-house
of Scofield Brothers, re-entered his cab, and drove to
St. Catherine’s Dock, to inquire for vessels bound for the
United States. After a diligent search of several hours he
found that there was no ship to sail for Baltimore in less
than two weeks. The first that was expected to leave for
that port was the Mercury, that would sail on or after the
fifteenth of June.</p>

<p class='c013'>Much disappointed, he returned to his hotel, called for
writing materials, dashed off a hasty letter to Mr. Oldfield,
detailing all that had happened, mailed it, called a cab, and
drove rapidly to the Liverpool depot, which he reached just
a few minutes before the cars left.</p>

<p class='c013'>His errand to Liverpool was to learn whether within less
than two weeks any vessel would leave that port for Baltimore.
He discovered that there was one to sail in six days
for Boston, one in a week to Halifax, and one in ten days
for New Orleans. But as neither of these promised a
quicker termination to his proposed voyage, or a speedier
meeting with Estelle than did the chances of the Mercury,
he turned from Liverpool in disappointment.</p>

<p class='c013'>He took the night train to Bristol, where he was more
fortunate in finding a vessel—the “Queen Charlotte”—that
would sail for Baltimore on or after the tenth of June.
Upon further inquiry at other ports, he found no more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>satisfactory prospect, and therefore he bespoke a passage
on the Queen Charlotte.</p>

<p class='c013'>He then went down to his seat in Dorsetshire, and employed
the intervening time in making judicious arrangements
for that voyage, which, could he have found a vessel
about immediately to sail for the United States, he would
certainly without any preparation have undertaken.</p>

<p class='c013'>Withal, however, it was a weary, weary decade of days
that passed before the tenth of June arrived, and Lord
Montressor found himself on board the good ship Queen
Charlotte.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a glorious summer morning, when the splendor
of the sky, the sparkling brightness of the water, the animating
bustle on the docks, and in the boats—all conspired
to raise and cheer the spirits of the spectator.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>At ten o’clock Lord Montressor entered the long-boat
that was to convey him to the Queen Charlotte, where he
found the captain, mate and men all engaged in the hearty
work of preparation for getting under way. A fair wind
had sprung up, and they were but waiting for the ebb tide.
They had not to wait long. At twelve precisely the tide
began to ebb. The captain came upon deck, seized his
speaking-trumpet, and called out,</p>

<p class='c013'>“All hands! Up anchor!”</p>

<p class='c013'>In an instant every man was upon deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Each officer to post! Man the capstan! Stand by to
let fall the tops’ils. Heave round the capstan! Heave
roundly!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir! Anchor’s apeak!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heave! Heave my hearties! Heave and trip the
anchor!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The men laid themselves to the bars, turned vigorously,
and then stopped to breathe.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A-trip it is, sir!” cried the mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moment the anchor was a-weigh the ship began to
cast to larboard.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain shouted through his speaking-trumpet—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hoist the jib and the fore-to’mas’ stays’ils! Helm-a-starboard!
So—steady—steady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir! Steady it is!” responded the helmsman.</p>

<p class='c013'>The crew worked heartily, the brave ship righted herself,
the sails filled with the breeze, and the Queen Charlotte,
stood gallantly out to the Channel. A shout from the
shore cheered her on.</p>

<p class='c013'>But she was not a fast sailer, this honest old Queen Charlotte,
any more than her royal namesake was a “fast woman.”
She was, on the contrary, “slow and sure,” like her good
old majesty, the defunct queen. She was, in fact, an old-fashioned,
short and square-bowed brig, one of the last of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>her generation, and very unlike in build and behavior to the
long and narrow-decked, high-masted and rakish Baltimore
clippers that were then in such high favor. In something
more than due time, then, the Queen Charlotte left Lundy
Island to leeward, got out of the Channel and into the
broad Atlantic.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fair wind continued for several days, and yet the brig
made but moderate progress. How she would possibly get
on against a head-wind remained to be seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>The season seemed to promise a continuance of fine
weather, and consequently a pleasant voyage, for the violent
spring gales were over, and the latter summer storms were
not soon to be expected.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet they had not been at sea more than two weeks before
the weather changed, the sky became dark and gloomy, the
wind sprang up, the waves arose, and for several days the
ship beat about in a high sea, against a head wind, making
no progress, scarcely able to hold her own. Day after day
showed the same scene—morning after morning the murky
sky, heavy with clouds, lowered down upon a turbulent sea,
broken into high and coursing waves, whose crests were
tipped with frost, like foam upon the lips of racers—night
after night the impenetrable darkness above, around, beneath,
and relieved only by the phosphoric glimmer and
sparkle of the crested waves. A frisky clipper might have
been lost in this gale, but the staid old Queen Charlotte
“stood the storm” for a week.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then there came another change of weather, bringing
a clear sky, gentle breeze, and a calm sea, which continued
with little variation for two or three weeks, during
which the brig made moderate headway.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ill could Lord Montressor brook this sort of “making
haste slowly.” Often he reproached himself for taking passage
in the Charlotte, instead of waiting ten days longer to
embark in the Mercury. And this regret was in no degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>lessened by an event that occurred when they were nearing
the Azores.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a very fine day in August, with a fair, brisk wind,
and the Queen Charlotte, being in most unaccountably gay
spirits, had crowded on all her canvas, even to the studding
sails and royals, and was doing her best at running before
the wind—as if her long defunct majesty had ever in her
court array forgotten her royal dignity and tried to run!
While thus going under full sail the brig was hailed by a
vessel bearing down full upon her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ship—ahoy-oy!” came reverberating over the water
from the speaking-trumpet of the purser.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Halloo!” responded the Queen Charlotte.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are you? where do you hail from? where are you
bound?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Queen Charlotte, Brownloe master, from Bristol to
Baltimore! Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Mercury, Captain Brande, from London to Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost as she spoke she bore rapidly down upon the
brig, came alongside, and without stopping, cheered and
passed!</p>

<p class='c013'>But among the passengers that crowded the upper deck,
Lord Montressor had recognized a man, whose appearance
there sent all the blood from his heart to his brain!</p>

<p class='c013'>This man was Victoire L’Orient.</p>

<p class='c013'>How came he there? What was his object?</p>

<p class='c013'>He also was going to America—to Baltimore! Why?
What should carry him thither? Was he going in pursuit
of Estelle? Had he, perhaps, managed to keep up a system
of espionage around her? Had he discovered her flight to
America—to Baltimore? and would he pursue her thither
and persecute her there?</p>

<p class='c013'>Before these questions had fairly formed themselves
in the mind of Lord Montressor, the Mercury, with her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>crew and passengers, had cheered again, and passed far
ahead.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Queen Charlotte, comparatively “slow and sure,”
even when under full sail and before a fresh wind, and unflurried
either by the example of the Mercury or the impatience
of her own passengers and crew, kept on the even
tenor of her way.</p>

<p class='c013'>All that afternoon and that night she sailed before a fair
wind, and at sunrise the next morning entered the port of
Fayal.</p>

<p class='c013'>There again she spoke the Mercury, that was just passing
out of the harbor.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet <em>once more</em> the Queen Charlotte saw the Mercury.
Alas! but we anticipate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The brig remained in the port of Fayal two days to
discharge a portion of her cargo and to take in freight, as
well as to obtain a supply of fresh provisions and water, and
then again set sail.</p>

<p class='c013'>The weather continued fine, with little variation in the
clear sky, fresh wind and gentle sea for several days, during
which the brig made fair progress toward the Chesapeake.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the morning of the twentieth of August that the
man on the look-out cried:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Land ho!” and the distant points of Cape Charles and
Cape Henry hove in sight. And an hour after noon the
Queen Charlotte entered the Bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>That night the wind suddenly fell. And the next day—a
day ever to be remembered on that coast—the brig
lay becalmed under a burning sky, and upon a motionless
sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now my mind shrinks from describing the events
that made hideous that afternoon and night; shrinks both
because of the deep horror one feels in reflecting upon those
awful scenes of storm and devastation, when sky and ocean
meet in deadly conflict, and fire, air and water—all the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>elements of organized nature seem resolving back into
original “chaos and old night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This day—the twenty-first of August, when the Queen
Charlotte lay becalmed in the Chesapeake—had, as I said,
been still and hot, with an oppressive, suffocating atmosphere.
Though there was not a cloud in the sky, a ripple
on the water, nor a breath of wind from any quarter, yet
the experienced old seamen seemed grave and thoughtful,
and looked to the rigging of their ship. And the captain
paced the deck, casting an eye—now to the sky, now to
the sea, and now to the rigging.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What can be the matter with the skipper?” asked one
inexperienced passenger of another.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He’s on the look-out for squalls,” answered the other,
carelessly, not believing what they said.</p>

<p class='c013'>Abaft, two Baltimore youths, homeward bound, were
leaning over the taffrail, looking despondently into the
motionless water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was ever such a sea and such a sky as this? Not a
ripple, not a breath, and as hot as Hades! Heaven send
that the wind would rise!” complained one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! it is a right down deuced bore to lay becalmed
here, for days, perhaps, almost in gunshot of port,” grumbled
the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, d’ye see them two d——d land lubbers with their
elbows on the taffrail?” observed one bronzed and grizzled
old “salt” to his shipmate. “They want to hurry the wind
up! Avast there, my fine fellows! don’t you be impatient!
The wind will come out from the west, and speak to you
presently!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As noon approached an ominous change crept over the
face of the heavens and the waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not a cloud was to be seen, yet the whole heavens visibly
darkened, assuming a dull, hazy, coppery hue.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>Not a billow ruffled the surface of the waters, yet the
whole vast sea perceptibly swelled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not a breath of wind stirred, yet at intervals a low voice
wailed across the waters as if nature mourned the coming
destruction.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain still walked the deck, telescope in hand,
making observations, and occasionally giving orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you think of the weather, captain? Is there
a storm brewing?” asked Lord Montressor, joining him.</p>

<p class='c013'>The skipper lowered his glass, and turning upon the
questioner a sly look that might have been read—Do you
really think I am going to tell you now?—replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“By the soul of Nelson! I cannot at this moment inform
you, my lord. It may be only a fresh wind that will take
us large into port; and then again it may be the confoundest
hurricane that has ever been seen on this coast!—Avast
there! Mate, see that the lightning conductors are rigged
out!” he said, suddenly breaking off to give the order.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir,” replied that officer, touching his hat, and
going below to obey the command.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At least,” said Lord Montressor, resuming the conversation,
“you have sufficient time to take every necessary
precaution for the safety of the vessel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humph—humph—why certainly it is not exactly upon
us yet, whatever it is! and I and the ‘Charlotte’ have
weathered a storm before to-day. Why, sir! I could tell
you of a time, when we doubled Cape Horn——,” said the
skipper, launching into a tale of a tempest that was presently
interrupted—the tale—not the tempest—by the reappearance
of the mate on deck, to report the lightning conductors
rigged out.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As you said, my lord, there is time to make ready for
what may be coming, thank heaven! This may be only a
fresh wind that will carry us gallantly into port; therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>I shall not take in sail just yet; though it is best to be
ready at short notice to do so. Mate!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Call all hands on deck!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let them stand by to take in the royals and to’gallant
stun’s’ils.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>As the meridian passed, the sun took on a dark blood-like
color, and the awful stillness of the elements seemed more
foreboding.</p>

<p class='c013'>Slowly—slowly the Spirit of the Storm advanced and
took shape.</p>

<p class='c013'>A black cloud, seemingly no larger than an eagle with
spread wings, appeared on the Western horizon, directly
under the sun. The wind awoke with a sigh, and breathed
across the waters, curling the surface into little ripples, and
moving the sails of the brig, and then died away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In royals!” shouted the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The order was executed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cloud climbed faster, higher, increasing in size and
darkness. Again the wind arose and moaned across the
waters, rolling the waves against the tide and fluttering the
sails of the ship, and then died away as before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take in the to’gallant stu’n-s’ils! And you at the wheel,
mind your helm!” thundered the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The cloud had nearly reached the zenith. Once more
the wind sprung up, and roared across the now angry
waters, driving the sea into high waves, and filling all the
sails of the brig that now bounded before the blast.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Clew down the topsails; haul up the courses! Hard
down!” shouted the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The storm came on apace, the whole sky was overcast
and darkened. The wind lashed the sea into fury and drove
the brig rocking and reeling forward, on her course.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The passengers swarmed upon the deck, and crowded
around the skipper.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Captain, captain, is there any danger?” asked one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Captain, captain!” exclaimed several others, as the
skipper, regardless of their interruptions, hurried about
giving his orders. “Captain, captain!——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For heaven’s sake, gentlemen, go below! You are in
my way! You hinder me in the working of the ship!
You risk your own lives as well as the safety of the vessel,”
said the skipper, impatiently, hastening away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—for the Lord’s sake, what are you going to do?”
asked the first speaker, laying hold of the captain’s coat-skirt
to detain him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are trying to get into Hampton Roads: there we
shall be safe. Once more, for heaven’s sake, gentlemen, be
advised, and go below!” exclaimed the captain, breaking
away.</p>

<p class='c013'>A vivid flash of lightning, kindling into blue flame every
scrap of metal about the ship, accompanied by an awful
peal of thunder, and followed by a sudden deluge of rain,
so enforced the order, that most of the passengers were
glad to make a hasty retreat.</p>

<p class='c013'>The storm hurried onward; the whole heavens lowered
down upon the sea, and all was black as the blackest midnight,
save when a dazzling flash of lightning kindled the
whole scene into a momentary conflagration; showing the
whole tremendous sea, rising and falling in mountains and
valleys, and clouds and waves mingling together in wildest
chaos, so that, which was the heavens, and which was the
earth, it was almost impossible to know. And through all
this horrible confusion, the brave ship—heaving, plunging,
reeling,—struggled; now lifted upon the top of some mountain
wave, high among the clouds; then pitched headlong
down into the dreadful yawning, chasm of the sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain never for an instant left the deck. His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>presence there enheartened the crew, who worked gallantly.
But their almost superhuman efforts failed to get the ship
into Hampton Roads. She was driven furiously past their
entrance. Through all that awful night the captain never
left his post. At intervals some passenger, more venturous
than the others, would make the desperate attempt to come
upon deck; but even if he were not, by the heaving of the
ship, hurled headlong down the companion-ladder, he was
soon glad to retreat. The storm raged on with unabating
violence. The captain never lost his presence of mind, nor
the crew their courage. The former gave his orders, decisively,
clearly, emphatically—the latter obeyed with alacrity.
Every sail had been in succession taken in, and the
ship was now driving along under bare poles. As she had
done, many times before, the good ship weathered the storm.
Yet was the night not unmarked by disaster to her brave
crew; a heavy sea, taking her amidships, swept off three
of her gallant seamen; but in the dense darkness, or blinding
glare, amid the deafening noise of the tempest, this loss
was not known—it was not discovered until morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was long after midnight, when the fury of the storm
had in some degree abated; the ship was scudding along
before the wind, and the captain and the mate, exhausted
by their late tremendous labors, were resting on the deck,
when the distant report of a single cannon came booming
over the waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A ship in distress; but, great heaven! what earthly
power can aid her in such a night as this?” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mate made no reply, but listened anxiously for a
repetition of the signal.</p>

<p class='c013'>In about three minutes, the firing was repeated.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Lord help her,” said the mate reverently—“what
can be done for her, truly! We are making rapidly toward
her if it were broad day, we might help her. Or if she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>could exist till day, we might save the crew. What think
you, captain?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heaven, that depends upon circumstances. If in
beating about in this storm, she has sprung a leak, she must
go down in a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But if she has been cast upon a sand-bank, or driven
ashore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Even then it is doubtful whether we could aid her. If
she has been cast upon Smith’s Sand-bar, as I fear is the
case, we could not approach her without sharing her fate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the boats?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would not reach her in this sea.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the gale may go down before she breaks up,” suggested
the pitying and hopeful mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Heaven grant it; for if it should turn out so, we
may be of assistance,” replied the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every five minutes the signal gun was fired. The captain,
mate and crew, listened in impotent sympathy, or spoke
together in hushed and solemn voices; for well they knew
that, but for the blessing of Providence upon their almost
superhuman exertions, this case of shipwreck might have
been their own.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the Queen Charlotte flew before the wind.
At every firing of the signal gun, she seemed nearer the
sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are approaching that other ship! We must look
out, and not run afoul of her,” said the captain, leaving his
position, and going forward to give orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once again the signal gun was fired, and then it was
heard no more. When ten or fifteen minutes had elapsed,
and the listening crew found no repetition of the sound—</p>

<p class='c013'>“God help her,” said the captain, “she is lost!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The crew echoed his groan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Day dawned, and the sun arose over a wild, wild scene.
Black and ragged clouds, the fragments of the broken storm,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>drove across the sky. The wind was still very strong, and
the waves ran very high.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Queen Charlotte scudded along under a close-reefed
main topsail and reefed foresail. She kept a sharp look out for
some sign of the fate of the ship she had heard firing the signal
guns in the night. The mate took his post forward, and
with telescope in hand, scanned the expanse of sea ahead.
And thus it was scarcely a quarter of an hour after sunrise,
that that officer suddenly dropped his glass and called out:</p>

<p class='c013'>“A wreck on the sand-bank ahead!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain hurried forward, seized the glass from the
hand of the mate, leveled it and took sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By my life, it is the poor Mercury! and if we do not
look sharp we shall run foul of her! Mind what you are
about there at the wheel. Hard up. Hard up—so!
Steady—steady!” cried the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ship answered her helm, and presently came in sight
of the wreck.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a terrible spectacle.</p>

<p class='c013'>There before them lay the sand-bank and the broken
ship!</p>

<p class='c013'>The ill-fated Mercury had been pitched headforemost
with such tremendous force upon the bank, that her prow
was buried deep in the sands, and her stern lifted, revealing
one-third of the length of her keel. Her masts had been
snapped short off, and with all their sails and shrouds had
fallen forward upon the sand. And there she lay stranded,
broken, helpless—exposed to every assault of wind and
wave! At intervals a heavy sea broke over her. A nearer
approach showed some half-dozen haggard wretches, the
remnant of her unfortunate crew, assembled aft, holding on
for dear life to the taffrail, yet scarcely able to keep their
hold, with their hair and garments streaming in the wind.
They were seen to wave signals of entreaty to the advancing
ship.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>But a horrible sea raged between the brig and the sand-bank!
To have approached much nearer the wreck, would
have been inevitably to share its fate! To have put out a
boat would have been madness!—no boat could have lived
a moment in such a sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet the Queen Charlotte could not, would not, pass her
by. The only thing to do then, was to wear and heave to,
to watch and seize an opportunity of rendering aid, if perchance
the winds and waves should subside in time to send
out boats to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it was a terrible thing to lay there inactive, and behold
sea after sea advance and break over that bound and
disabled vessel!—at every advance shaking her hull almost
in pieces—at every retreat carrying off some portion of her
rigging or cargo. And it was more terrible still to behold
those half-dozen fellow-creatures, clinging in desperation to
their frail support!</p>

<p class='c013'>At last a huge wave arose and rearing itself, like a moving
cliff crested with foam, advanced upon the doomed
wreck!</p>

<p class='c013'>At this appalling sight, all on board the brig held their
breath for very awe.</p>

<p class='c013'>The mountain wave reached and broke over the sand-bank.
And the ship was swamped!</p>

<p class='c013'>A simultaneous cry of horror arose from the brig!</p>

<p class='c013'>The next moment fragments of the shattered ship strewed
the sea, and from amid the boiling hell of waters arose three
struggling wretches.</p>

<p class='c013'>One held on to a broken spar that kept him afloat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two others, for a single instant, strove for the possession
of a plank that both had seized, but which was not sufficient
to sustain more than one; then the stronger of the two,
whom Lord Montressor thought he recognized as Victoire
L’Orient, freeing his hand, struck off the weaker, who immediately
sank, but in the impetuosity of this cruel blow he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>also lost his own hold upon the plank, and disappeared in
the whirlpool of waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>The third man—the sole survivor of the wreck, clinging
desperately to the fragment of broken spar, and each
moment growing more incapable of retaining his hold,
was dashed hither and thither, at the mercy of the waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, who had been standing, leaning over
the bulwarks, chafing with impatience at his own inactivity,
could now endure this sight no longer. It was not in his
brave and generous nature thus to stand and behold a fellow-creature
helpless amid such deadly peril, and not wish
to risk life if needful for his rescue. Lord Montressor was
a man of athletic and powerful frame, as well as of heroic
spirit. He had been trained in all those gymnastic exercises
calculated to develope extraordinary muscular strength
and skill. Calling upon a seaman to assist him, he hastily
stripped off his upper garments, fastened a strong rope securely
around his waist, and, against the vehement expostulations
of all who were near him, threw himself into the
raging sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain, crew and passengers watched him in intense
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c013'>Buffeting the billows, he made toward the struggling
wretch. Wind and tide were in his favor, though three
times was he violently thrown back. Yet would he not
give the signal to be drawn in. He seemed resolved to
save the shipwrecked man or share his fate. At length it
was due as much to an apparent accident, as to his own
strength and skill, that he was enabled to effect his purpose—a
friendly wave lifting him upon its breast, cast him forward
in reach of the spar; simultaneously he threw his arms
out and seized the man; it was time! the strength of the
poor wretch was exhausted,—he was about to drop off!
Wave after wave dashed over them, as if the sea had resolved
to sever them, but Lord Montressor held on bravely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>to his prize. He gave the signal; the men on board the
brig began to haul in the rope, and in a few moments more
the shipwrecked man and his gallant preserver were safe
upon the deck of the Queen Charlotte!</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor left his charge in the hands of the
sailors, and to escape the congratulations of his companions,
as well as to change his wet clothes, he went below.</p>

<p class='c013'>Amid all the horror with which he reflected upon the
scenes of the shipwreck, one question forced itself upon his
mind. Victoire L’Orient had been a passenger on board
the ill-fated Mercury—was he lost or saved?—was he the
man who had been seen to strike his fellow from the floating
plank and perish in the cruel act? had he, in fact, been
among the number of the passengers who had been swept
off from the stern gallery? Or had he, perhaps, previously
taken passage in some boat, that might, at some earlier
hour of the disaster, have left the wreck in the desperate hope
of reaching the shore? and had he perchance so reached
the shore?—in a word, was he lost or saved? This question,
as it was inevitable it should—pressed anxiously upon
his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>And yet, reader, had Lord Montressor believed the man
whom he saved to be Victoire L’Orient, he would just as
certainly have risked his life for his preservation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, the beaten and battered victim of the wreck
was taken into the captain’s cabin, supplied with dry
clothing, refreshed with bread and wine, and forced to lie
down upon a berth to recover his exhausted strength. The
captain, who like all old sailors, was a tolerably good physician,
would not permit his guest to be questioned until he
had some rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And, indeed,” said the old skipper, “he is Lord Montressor’s
own prize, and shall be examined first of all by his
lordship!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And in truth the stranger seemed to be of a similar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>opinion; for after he had been refreshed by a short rest,
his first request was that he might be able to see and thank
his brave preserver.</p>

<p class='c013'>Word to this effect was transmitted to Lord Montressor,
who lost no time in obeying the summons. He entered the
cabin, and took his seat by the side of the berth upon which
the shipwrecked passenger lay.</p>

<p class='c013'>The stranger seemed to be a man of about twenty-two
years of age, of symmetrical form and handsome face,
having a Grecian profile; fair, clear complexion; golden-brown
hair, and dark, hazel eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad to find you so well recovered, my friend,”
said Lord Montressor, looking with kind interest upon his
rescued waif.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, my lord—I beg pardon! but I understood
my gallant preserver to be the Viscount Montressor,” said
the young man, fixing his dark, expressive eyes with a look
of inquiry upon the face of his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is my name, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And mine is Julius Levering. I am a Baltimore man,
my Lord, and am not unacquainted with the fame of Lord
Montressor,” said the youth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor gravely waived this compliment, and
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope that you have suffered no injury from the floating
fragments of the wreck, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you; none, my lord,” said Julius Levering,
passing his hand thoughtfully across his brow; then withdrawing
it, he added, “In truth, I know not <em>how</em>, in adequate
terms, to express my eternal gratitude to your lordship
for the preservation of my life.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank Providence, my dear sir, and not me. My act
was too instinctive to merit recollection,” returned Lord
Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“But, my dear lord, you risked your own valuable life to
save that of a stranger!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As I should have also risked it to save an enemy. The
act was merely impulsive—inevitable, I may say! Pray
let us drop that part of the subject. Now tell me, if you
please, were there any other persons saved from the wreck,
do you know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great heaven! I do not, sir! We struck the sand-bank
just after midnight. At daybreak, fourteen of our
number left the ship in an open boat, that seemed to have
no chance of living in such a sea; they embarked in the
frantic expectation of being able to reach the Maryland
shore. Whether the boat ever made the land, or whether,
as is most likely, she went down amid the waves, I have no
means of knowing! I only know, that except myself,
those who preferred to remain and take their chances with
the ship, fared no better than she did, whatever her fate
may have been. Before that last great sea took us—and
even before your ship hove in sight of us—we had lost
several of our companions, blown off or washed off from
their frail hold. Among those who were swept off right
before my eyes, was a poor old fragile French woman—one
Madame L’Orient. Good heaven! shall I ever get rid of
that vision!”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Deeply shocked as he was, Lord Montressor bent earnestly
forward to listen for something further.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mr. Levering, apparently overcome with the thought
of the scenes through which he had just passed, covered
his face with his hands, and continued silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>The doubt that troubled Lord Montressor remained unsolved.
For all that he could gather from Mr. Levering’s
conversation, Victoire L’Orient might have been lost in the
ship, or saved in the boat—supposing that the latter had
lived to reach the shore. That his mother had preferred to
stay in the ship, where she finally perished, was no sure
sign that Victoire had not deserted her there, as he surely
might have done had she persisted in remaining while he
chose to depart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally, unwilling to disturb Mr. Levering with questions
upon this painful subject, conscious also, perhaps, of feeling
too deep an interest in the fate of Monsieur L’Orient,
Lord Montressor bade his new acquaintance good-day,
and, leaving him to repose, went up on deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>The storm had spent its fury. The wind and waves, as
if they had accomplished the object for which they arose,
had now subsided.</p>

<p class='c013'>The scene on deck was a stirring one. The captain,
mate and crew were all busily engaged. One party, under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>the direction of the captain, were preparing to get under
sail. Another set, at the orders of the mate, were letting
down the boats.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain stood forward, leveling his glass at the sand-bank
that, strewn with sea-weed, shells and fragments of
the wreck, now loomed largely from the retiring waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor came up to the side of the skipper,
who immediately lowered his glass and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are making ready to get under sail, my lord! But
first I shall send the boats to the sand-bank to bring off
that body, which has been cast ashore there, and give it
Christian burial, at least, if it be only in the depths of the
sea! By the general appearance, I think it is the body of
that man that beat the other one off the plank and
drowned himself in the act. There! you can see for yourself,
my lord.” And the captain placed the glass in the
hands of his passenger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor raised the instrument and took sight at
the sand-bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes! there, thrown up by the waves, partially buried in
the sand, and slightly covered with sea-weed, lay the dead
body of a man! Various fragments of the wrecked ship,
and remnants of its cargo—spars, yards, planks, barrels,
casks and strong boxes, more or less broken and staved
open, were scattered about. From these various objects
Lord Montressor turned his glass once more upon the dead
body. It certainly did bear some resemblance to the man
who had struck his companion from the plank, and perished
in the deed; but beyond this Lord Montressor could not
form any conclusive opinion in regard to it. With a sigh
he dropt the telescope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Two boats were now lowered, manned, and pushed off
from the brig.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor watched their course with his naked
eye until they reached the scene of the wreck; then he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>once more raised the telescope to scan more closely their
operations on the sand bar.</p>

<p class='c013'>The men in the small boat landed first, and reverently
raised the corpse and carried it on board their boat, where
they covered it with a sail cloth; then they returned to the
sands and joined the men from the large boat, who went
about among the waifs of the wreck, selecting such casks,
barrels and boxes as had received the least injury, and were
the most worthy of preservation. When this was done and
the second boat was laden, the men embarked again and
rowed back to the Queen Charlotte.</p>

<p class='c013'>The large boat with the rescued relics of the wreck
reached the brig first, and was unladen before the small
boat, propelled slowly with measured strokes, in honor of
the dead she bore, arrived.</p>

<p class='c013'>She pulled up to the starboard gangway, where the captain,
mate, and many of the passengers were assembled to
receive her.</p>

<p class='c013'>The corpse, still wrapped in the sail-cloth, was reverently
lifted out, hoisted up, and laid upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>The face and breast were uncovered, and exposed to inspection.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there any one present who is able to identify this
body?” inquired the captain, possibly as a mere matter of
form, for it was not probable that any other than the shipwrecked
passenger, then resting in the cabin, could be competent
to do so.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many, however, crowded around to examine the features
of the corpse. It seemed that of a man of about thirty
years of age, of tall, slight figure, brown complexion, black
hair, eyebrows, and mustachios, and features that seemed
to have originally been regular and handsome, as far as
their present distorted and stiffened condition allowed the
spectator to judge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor stood among the lookers-on, and, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>folded arms and serious brow, gazed upon the face of the
dead. And well he might! It was the cause of all his
woe—it was the mortal foe of Estelle—it was, in a word,
Victoire L’Orient that lay dead before him!</p>

<p class='c013'>No one spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well?” asked the captain, looking around upon the
tamest faces bent over the body.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I can identify this corpse, Captain Brande,” said the
solemn voice of Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>All eyes were now turned upon his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my lord?” said the captain.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is the body of a Frenchman, by name Victoire
L’Orient, a native of Paris, and a late passenger on board
the Mercury. It would be well, also, to have this identity
further proved by Mr. Levering, the rescued passenger
below.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lord Montressor, having delivered these words,
bowed gravely and withdrew from the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>The corpse was again wrapped in the canvas and carried
aft to the stern gallery, where it was laid and covered
over, while preparations were made for the burial.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Levering, after an hour’s repose, dressed himself
in a suit of clothes supplied to him by Lord Montressor’s
valet, and came up on deck to look about; hearing that a
dead body had been picked up and recognized as that of
Victoire L’Orient, he inquired where it lay; and being informed,
he went aft to the stern gallery to behold it. Arrived
upon the spot, he stooped, raised the covering, and
gazed upon the face of the dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had a heavy stake in the fate of this man, beside
whose corse he stood wrapped in the closest thought. He
started like a detected criminal in hearing a voice speak at
his side:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg your parding, Capting, but do you also know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>this corpse?” said a man in livery, touching his hat as he
joined him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my friend, this is the body of Monsieur Victoire
L’Orient, my late fellow-passenger,” replied Mr. Levering,
recovering his self-possession.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beg your parding again, Capting, but are you certain,
now, as this is really and truly the body of Mounseer
Wictwor?” repeated the new-comer, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course I am, friend,” replied Mr. Levering, gravely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can’t possibly be <em>any body else</em> by mistake can it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he is Mounseer Wictwor to a <em>dead certainty</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To a dead certainty, yes,” answered Mr. Levering,
wondering at the strange manner of the intruder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And was he <em>drownded</em> sure enough?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, he was.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And are you sure he is <em>quite</em> dead?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you not see for yourself?” asked Mr. Levering,
beginning to believe his new acquaintance to be a lunatic.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, he looks so, sartain; but then you never can
depend on these wenemous reptyles. They’re so uncommon
deceiving.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Deceiving?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; you never can be sure on ’em unless you bile
’em!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I don’t understand you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I mean they’re so werry apt to come round again—do
you think <em>he’ll</em> come round?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think he’ll not <em>come to life</em> presently?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does he look like it?” inquired Mr. Levering, now
firmly convinced that his interlocutor was a madman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, he don’t! but as I said afore you can’t place any
confidence in sich!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Nothing I only this here Mounseer was shipwracked
<em>once afore</em> and drownded—<em>dead</em>. And two years arfter,
when everybody had forgotten him, lo! and behold! he
comes to life and turns up most onconveniently, in the wrong
time and place, as sprightly as a sarpint in spring! and
gives no end to the trouble to those in high places!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray, friend, who are <em>you</em>?” inquired Mr. Levering of
the supposed maniac.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One of his lordship, Lord Montressor’s grooms.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” exclaimed Mr. Levering, with the air of a man
upon whom a sudden light had broken.</p>

<p class='c013'>The men coming aft to prepare the dead body for burial,
interrupted the conversation. The new acquaintances both
left the stern gallery. The groom went down to the gundeck
to gossip with the sailors. And Mr. Levering proceeded
to inspect the waifs of the wreck that had been
brought on board. He seemed very much relieved to find
among them a strong box which he immediately claimed
and proved to be his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>At noon that day the solemn ceremony of a “Burial at
Sea” was performed. The crew were all piped on deck,
and amid a reverential silence, the captain read the impressive
funeral service of the Episcopal Church. And at its
conclusion the body was solemnly committed to the deep.</p>

<p class='c013'>And immediately afterward the Queen Charlotte once
more set sail. And from this hour an uninterrupted season
of fine weather, with a fresh wind, favored her until the
fifth day, a beautiful Sabbath near the last of August, when
at sunrise the Queen Charlotte, with all her flags flying, anchored
in Baltimore harbor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same morning Lord Montressor bade adieu to his
late companion, and left the ship for his hotel.</p>

<p class='c013'>If any circumstance would have augmented his intense
desire to meet Estelle, it must have been his possession of
the important information he had now to communicate to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>her. He considered the events of the recovery of the
drowned body by the crew of the Queen Charlotte, and his
own presence on the spot to identify the corpse as that of
Victoire L’Orient, as providential. He felt assured that
certainty in regard to the fate of this man must at least give
peace to the tempest-tost life of Estelle. He hoped also
that it would change her purposes and settle her future.
And now that he had reached port, his anxiety to find her
was almost insupportable. But the Sabbath must be lived
through; nay, indeed notwithstanding his weak human impatience,
it must be duly honored! He compelled himself
to be quiet, and went to the Episcopal church twice that
day—attending St. George’s in the forenoon, and St. John’s
in the afternoon, in the faint vain hope also that at one or
the other he might possibly see Estelle, whom he knew to
be a scrupulous and regular attendant upon Divine Service.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, after a night of sleepless anxiety, he arose early
on Monday morning, and as soon as there was any possibility
of finding the bankers at their place of business, he
took a carriage and drove it to the banking-house of Somerville
and Son. He found the senior partner already at his
desk. He introduced himself, and made inquiries relative
to the lady of whom he came in search.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alas! Alas!</p>

<p class='c013'>At first Mr. Somerville, senior, knew nothing about such
a lady—had never seen or heard of her, and was certain,
begging his lordship’s pardon, that she had never honored
their establishment with a call. But at this point of the
conversation, Mr. Somerville, junior, who had been standing
at another desk, listening with his pen behind his ear, came
forward and recalled to his father’s mind the beautiful English
lady, dressed in deep mourning, who had come from
the house of Scofield Brothers, London, and had called upon
them just two weeks ago.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then—yes! oh, yes! the old banker did not remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>the lovely lady in mourning, but he remembered the heavy
drafts drawn by Scofield Brothers on them, in favor of——now,
who <em>was</em> it in favor of? He referred to his papers
and found—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that was the lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Well! the lady had received her money and had departed.
And that was all they knew of her. And from them Lord
Montressor received no other satisfaction.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>While Lord Montressor pursues his search for Estelle,
we must take up the fortunes of some other persons who
are concerned in our narrative. But first a brief review of
Victorie L’Orient’s course seems necessary to the reader’s
better understanding of what follows:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Tis hard for human actions to account,</div>
      <div class='line'>Whether from reason, or from impulse only,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>writes the lamented Thomas Hood.</p>

<p class='c013'>It would certainly be difficult to explain satisfactorily
the motives of the course of conduct pursued by Victoire
L’Orient toward the hapless lady whose evil fortune had
placed her peace, if not her destiny, in his power. One
would have naturally supposed that, being released from
his penal life, he would have proceeded directly to England,
and while her hand was yet free, would have openly demanded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>possession of the woman whom he claimed as his
wife. Why he did not do so—why, on the contrary, he
chose to wait for the hour when she should bestow her
hand on another, to humble her before the whole world, is
the unresolved problem. Of course every theory of his
motives must be purely speculative.</p>

<p class='c013'>Judging, however, from what we have already seen of
his character and have heard of his history, it is neither unreasonable
nor uncharitable, to suppose the following to
have been the case:</p>

<p class='c013'>A man like Victoire L’Orient, of depressed moral and
intellectual nature, usually feels a strong antagonism to a
woman who is brought into constant and rebuking comparison
with himself, especially when that woman is his
own wife, whom he deems should of right be in all respects
his inferior and subordinate. Very soon must Monsieur
Victoire have discovered the moral and intellectual excellence
of the young creature whom he had ensnared, and
consequently the wide disparity of character between himself
and her. This alone was sufficient to have galled a
spirit so egotistical as his own. And when we remember
that in addition to this, Estelle inevitably detected his utter
unworthiness, and that, notwithstanding her sweet patience
and forbearance, she must unavoidably, through the very
truthfulness and ingenuousness of her character, have
revealed the low estimation in which she held him, we need
not feel any degree of surprise that his selfish passion for
her was largely alloyed with hate, and that his desire to
possess, was quite equalled by his wish to humble her.</p>

<p class='c013'>With these feelings and purposes, having been pardoned,
or having served out his time in Algiers, he embarked in
the “Duc D’Anjou” for France. Picked up by an Algerine
corsair from the wreck of that vessel, he had been reconveyed
to the Barbary States. Escaping thence, he once
more returned to Europe.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>He came to England to claim the hand of Estelle, or,
failing to obtain it, to extort money from her parents as
the price of silence and absence.</p>

<p class='c013'>But on arriving at Exeter, and hearing of her approaching
nuptials with the Viscount Montressor, and being
ignorant of the good and sufficient reasons she possessed
for supposing himself to be deceased, all the most malignant
passions of his heart were enkindled, and all the most
cunning faculties of his mind were employed to enable him
to meet the exigency in a manner that should at the same
time punish Estelle and profit himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Feeling no doubt of the legality of that rite by which he
supposed he had secured her person and fortune, yet fearing,
nevertheless, that in the event of his <em>then</em> claiming her
hand, her father would interfere, and, by means of his vast
wealth and influence, contrive to invalidate, or in some
other manner break the bond that united them, he, with a
demon’s art, resolved to reserve himself, to conceal the
fact of his existence for awhile, to allow her—unconscious
of his presence in the country—to go to the altar, and then,
armed with a warrant for her arrest, spring a trap upon
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not that he intended she should suffer the extreme
penalty of the law; but that he wished to degrade her in
the eyes of the whole world, so that even her haughty
parents should be willing, as their only resort, to resign
her, with her fortune, to his possession. To accomplish
this end, it had been his purpose, after the interruption of
the nuptials by the arrest of the bride, to have had an explanation,
and come to a compromise with Estelle’s family,
and in the event of their closing with his terms, to have
withdrawn his witnesses, so that at the trial before the
Judge of the Assizes, there should be no evidence against
her, who, being then free, though ruined, would fall to his
undisputed possession.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Fortunately for Estelle, her advocate, Lord Dazzleright,
at once detected the policy of the prosecuting party. And
the manner in which the charge was met and the defense
conducted at the preliminary investigation, disabused Monsieur
Victoire of the false hope of obtaining possession of
Estelle, and at the same time aroused all the vindictive
passions of his nature, that instigated him to have her
prosecuted to the utmost extent of the law.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the occasion of the trial before the Assizes, the
charge of the Judge to the jury—in which his lordship distinctly
declined to pronounce upon the validity of the alleged
first marriage, declaring that to be a matter for the
adjudication of the spiritual courts—had again, however
irrationally, revived his hopes.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the conclusion of the trial, he determined to keep
trace of Estelle, and to file a petition to be heard upon his
claim, before the Court of Arches.</p>

<p class='c013'>He soon discovered the flight of Estelle to London, and
subsequently her embarkation for Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c013'>In pursuit of her he took passage on the Mercury bound
for the same port.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Monsieur Victoire had still another motive, (which
shall be revealed,) for his voyage to America.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most debased and unfortunate of wretches possibly
have some friends whom they love or by whom they are beloved.
And this miserable Victoire had his mother, who
doted on him, and a fellow voyager on whom he doted.
The name of the last mentioned was Julius Luxmore. How
he had first become acquainted with this young man it is
not necessary now to relate. It is sufficient to say that he
had known him intimately for about two years.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the moment of Victoire L’Orient’s embarkation on
board the Mercury, his spirits had suffered a reaction into
gloom and apathy, to which those of his volatile nation are
frequently subject. And this despondency increased with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>every league of the voyage, until, when half across the Atlantic
ocean, it amounted to absolute despair. He passed
much of the day in leaning over the bulwarks of the vessel,
gazing gloomily into the sea, and sometimes muttering to
himself:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall never see Etoile! I shall never see Etoile!”</p>

<p class='c013'>One afternoon he was thus standing in the stern of the
vessel with his elbow resting on the taffrail, his chin leaning
upon his hand, and his eyes fixed intently upon the foaming
sea in the wake of the vessel, when his friend came up to
his side, touching his elbow, and said, cheerily:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, come, shipmate! Do you think we are near a
sunken reef? And are you making leaden plummets
of your eyeballs to take the soundings? What are you
gazing at?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Mon tombeau</em>,” answered the Frenchman, gloomily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘These things must not be thought on after these ways
so, it will make us mad,’ as the tender-hearted Lady Macbeth
says.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Mais, mon Dieu!</em> I shall never see Etoile! I shall
never see Etoile!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Consider it not so deeply!’ I think you have every
thing to hope. You must not judge her inclinations by the
action of her counsel. Reflect; she has fled from Lord
Montressor, not from you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Grand heaven! who talks of her? It is not of Estelle,
my demon of a wife, that I speak!” exclaimed Victoire,
shrugging his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of whom then? Etoile—Etoile—I never heard the
name. Has Monsieur Victoire perhaps <em>consoled</em> himself
for the absence of Madame Estelle?” inquired Luxmore in
a tone of raillery.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! no, no,” replied the Frenchman in the same
mournful tone—“I speak of my child—my daughter—my
pretty little Etoile!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>“Your child!” exclaimed Luxmore in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my friend. Mon Dieu! Yes, my daughter, my
dear Etoile!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you never told me you had a child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But yes, mon Dieu! I have! I did from all the fact
conceal. Listen you. You shall hear. That woman of
perdition, Estelle, had a child—a daughter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it possible! and that child lives?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, yes! my beautiful Etoile! My princess of the
Isle! My star of the sea!” exclaimed the Frenchman,
with real or feigned enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You astonish me. And her mother——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does not know she lives. Attend you. I will, from
you, nothing hide. She has an uncle—the King of the
isle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Eh? What?” exclaimed the other in perplexity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have an uncle—the King of the Isle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My poor Victoire, has grief unsettled your reason?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just now you spoke of your daughter as princess of the
Isle, but as you also called her a star of the sea, I considered
both phrases figurative. Now, however, when you talk
gravely of your uncle, who is the King of the Island——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But grand Dieu! my dear and good friend, you comprehend
not. I have one uncle who is a bachelor—old and
rich, and resident for a long time upon an island in the sea.
But, mon Dieu! he is foolish, imbecile, idiotic,” said Victoire,
in a tone of real or assumed grief.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am sorry, since it distresses you; but I cannot see what
your mad uncle has to do with the life of your daughter or
the ignorance of her mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, my faith! it has a great deal to do with both the
one and the other. Attend you. I shall nothing conceal.
Regard you. You shall know all. Listen you, then, my
dear friend!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>And Monsieur Victoire L’Orient commenced an explanation
which I beg leave to disembarrass from his idiomatic
French and broken English and give in less unintelligible
language.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seems from the representations of Monsieur Victoire
that the family of “L’Orient” really once belonged to the
ancient seignory of Provence. The younger and of
course poorer branch of that family, were of the company
of French Roman Catholics who went out with Lord Baltimore’s
emigrant troop, and settled the province of Maryland.</p>

<p class='c013'>This particular family fixed upon one of the loveliest and
loneliest of the Islands of the Chesapeake, and from that
day, through several successive generations, held it in their
exclusive possession. Indeed, their greatest desire, their
hereditary passion, seemed to be to keep this beloved and
beauteous Island in the family.</p>

<p class='c013'>In all these years the intercourse between the European
and the American branches of the old house was not suffered
to wane. On the contrary, several successive intermarriages
had revived and consolidated the relationship. Thus when
an heir of the Island reached man’s estate, his choice of a
bride was limited by the number of his marriageable female
cousins in France. Or if a daughter happened to be the
sole heiress, a husband was found for her among the males
of the same.</p>

<p class='c013'>The American branch of the house were called for distinction
L’Oriens <em>de l’Ile</em> (or, of the Island). But this
term in the course of time became a second surname,
or a sort of title, so that the owners of the Island were always
called Monsieur L’Orient De L’Ile. And any European
L’Orient who married a sole heiress of the Island
became in her right, also Monsieur L’Orient De L’Ile;—though
by his American neighbors of the coast, he was
called simply Mr. De L’Ile.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>We all know that successive intermarriages are not
favorable to any race. Hence it is not surprising that the
family of L’Oriens De L’Ile gradually died out. And the
last lineal descendant, Monsieur Hubert De L’Ile, who married
his first cousin, had neither son nor daughter to succeed
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>The European branch of the house that had remained in
France, and had married into other families, continued, on
the contrary, to be a handsome and vigorous race.</p>

<p class='c013'>And of such was the father of Monsieur Victoire.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Monsieur Victoire had, as he says, an uncle, the elder
brother of his father. This man, Monsieur Henri L’Orient,
was socially a bachelor and an oddity, and politically a
royalist and a Bourbonist. He had one grand passion, and
that was for—islands! or perhaps I should say for the
family Island in the Chesapeake, to which he was heir presumptive.
During the lifetime of Monsieur and Madame
Hubert De L’Ile, he made several voyages to the Chesapeake,
and spent many months on the Island. His love of
the place was immense, his praise of it extravagant, his
compliments to the proprietors as sincere as they were overwhelming.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are like a king and queen here! you are in your
insular domain! Your kingdom is only bounded by the
infinite sea!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus he became a great favorite with the childless old
people, who would laughingly reply:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, well! if it is so, if we are a king and queen, then
you are the prince and the heir of the kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And at their death they left a will bequeathing the Island
to Monsieur Henri L’Orient, and in case the latter
should die without children, to Monsieur Victoire L’Orient
and his heirs forever.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri L’Orient was sixty years old when he
“came to his kingdom.” It was not likely that he would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>take a wife and become the father of sons and daughters
at that age. So he invited his younger brother, with his
family, to accompany him to his insular domain. But
Madame, his sister-in-law, who was at that time young,
pretty, fashionable and extravagant, preferred the saloons
of Paris to the loveliest Island in the world. And so
Monsieur Hubert took leave of his relatives, and departed
alone for his “kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And years passed, during which the old man was too
much attached to his Island, and his relatives in Paris too
much devoted to pleasure, to permit an exchange of visits.</p>

<p class='c013'>But fifteen years after the separation, Madame was a
widow without youth, beauty or riches. And her good
brother-in-law wrote, proposing that she should come and
bring her son and take up her residence with him.</p>

<p class='c013'>But oh, horror! Madame could not think of such a
thing! She infinitely preferred to trust to her own resources
in Paris, rather than to go out to live among
“mulattos and mud turtles on his Island in the Bay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And with the help of friends, Madame opened her Pensionnat
des Demoiselles.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five more years passed, and old Monsieur Henri grew
older in the solitude of his insular “kingdom.” Now,
whether it were the effect of his strange and lonely life, the
approach of extreme old age, or the misfortunes of his
beloved Bourbons, or all of these causes combined, I know
not, but the mind of the old man became deranged upon
one subject, his grand passion became a monomania, his
jest grew earnest, his ownership of the Island appeared the
sovereignty of a kingdom, and his letters to his sister-in-law
and nephew were signed—with more rigid formality of
course than a real monarch would have used—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<span class='sc'>Henri, by grace of God, King of the Isles.</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>For as his monomania grew, he imagined that his sovereign
sway extended over all the Islands of the Bay. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>first, as his letters betrayed no other sign of the writer’s
mental alienation, his sister-in-law deemed this signature an
odd piece of pleasantry, as indeed in the first instance it
might have been; but when letter after letter came, gravely
signed in this manner, and when, in addition, he expressed
his great anxiety to see her son, the “Prince,” his nephew—Madame’s
eyes were opened!</p>

<p class='c013'>“This unfortunate old beast is mad!” she said; “we
must look after him!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But just as Madame came to this conclusion, her own
especial family affairs demanded her exclusive attention.
Her son Monsieur Victoire was on trial for treason; Victoire’s
baby-bride had a baby of her own that must be
concealed; her “pensionnat” was broken up; her character
was impeached; and finally the necessity of a change of
residence was for all these reasons imperative. She only
waited the result of Victoire’s trial, and when he was condemned
to Algiers, she gathered together the remnants of
her property, turned the whole into cash, took her stolen
grandchild, whom she chose, for private reasons of her own,
to represent, for the present, to its mother, as dead,—and
went down to Dijon. Thence she wrote to her brother-in-law,
“His Majesty, the King of the Isles,” that her son, the
“Prince,” his nephew, had experienced unheard-of misfortunes,
through his devotion to his allies, the Bourbons; and
that he was now banished to Algeria. But that his “Highness”
had left a child, an infant daughter, an angel of
beauty; and—what should she do with this child?</p>

<p class='c013'>The course of months brought back the old man’s answer.
The “King of the Isles” expressed the most exalted
admiration of his nephew, the Prince’s heroism, and the
most profound sorrow for his misfortunes; and ended by
entreating his unhappy sister-in-law to bring the “Princess,”
her granddaughter, to be educated at his own court.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great Heaven! that old animal is very mad! I hope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>he is not dangerous! Very well! if he should be, his
negro slaves are strong enough to bind him at my command.
And who will have a better right to command than I when
I get there?” said Madame, who being a prompt as well as
courageous woman, immediately wrote to the “Island
King,” saying that she should quickly follow her letter, and
have the honor of presenting the “Princess” at the court
of His Majesty. And so in the course of a few weeks
Madame, having in charge the yearling child, embarked on
board the “Sirene,” bound from Havre to Baltimore, engaging
the captain to put her on shore at L’Orient, or East
Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was after a prosperous voyage of two months, and upon
a most beautiful morning in May, that Madame was early
aroused from her berth to get ready to go on shore. Upon
occasion she could be quick in making her toilet, so in
twenty minutes from the opening of her eyes she stood upon
the deck, looking out for the long-talked of, the beloved,
the beauteous Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>There it lay before her, in its more than ideal loveliness!
There it lay like an emerald on the bosom of the bay! A
beautiful green island, dimpled with hill and valley, veined
with limpid streams, studded with gray and mossy rocks,
shaded with tall groves, and environed by the blue waters
that leaped and sparkled in the morning sun like a living
sea of liquid sapphires! There was a vivid and delicate
freshness of hue in the luxuriant vegetation of the Isle, as
peculiar as it was delightful. Far in the interior, from
amidst the green beauty of the grove, arose the many tall,
white chimneys of the Island mansion. Scattered about
in picturesque groups, were the white cottages of the negro
servants. Down on the beach was a white boat-house,
built in the shape of a Chinese pagoda.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame gazed in a sort of enthusiasm upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a magnificent place, after all! My faith! those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>comical De L’Iles did well to adore it! As for me, I shall
take that old madman in hand! I shall assume the direction
of affairs. I shall introduce a new order of things.
I shall form the acquaintance of the gentry on the main
land. I shall give <em>fetes</em> and dances! My Heaven! I
must amuse myself, or else I shall die of grief for poor
Victoire, or go mad like His Majesty, the King of the
Isles! And at last Victoire will come back; or at least
my little Etoile will grow up; and by-the-by, it is very
fortunate, my faith! that I have this child as a passport to
acceptance!” soliloquised Madame.</p>

<p class='c013'>And she had scarcely had time thus to lay out her future
before the long-boat came around to the starboard gangway,
and her trunks were lowered into it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boat awaits the pleasure of Madame,” said the
captain, offering himself to assist her in the descent.
Madame was carefully seated, the babe was put in her
arms, the six sailors plied their oars, and the boat skimmed
like a sea-bird the surface of the sparkling waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ten minutes brought them to the landing-place on the
Isle—a little pier beside the boat-house, painted white, and
ascended by three steps.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this pier an avenue of half a mile in length, shaded
by beautiful trees, led up through fields and pleasure grounds,
toward the house. All this, Madame saw at a glance,
while the boat was pushed up and moored.</p>

<p class='c013'>But upon the pier stood a most interesting group—namely,
“His Majesty, the King of the Isles,” and the
chief ministers of his court—in other words, Monsieur
Henri De L’Isle and a half dozen of his negro men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame gazed in a sort of consternation—she had expected
to find a very aged, decrepit, driveling madman.
“His Majesty,” on the contrary, though eighty years of
age, was still one of the finest looking men she had ever
set her eyes upon—tall, broad shouldered, and erect in form,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>with a fresh, handsome, noble countenance, surrounded by
a thick growth of hair and beard as white as snow. He
wore a purple cashmere morning-gown folded like a royal
robe about his person. His manner was dignified and
courteous, as he stood waiting to receive his guests. The
half-dozen negro men that were with him were neatly
dressed in white trousers and pink shirts, and were remarkable
for their healthful and joyous appearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very good! the madman and his familiars are not so
ill to look upon!” said Madame, as with the child in her
arms she left the boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri, with the air of the Grand Monarque,
came down to meet her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Welcome, illustrious lady and beloved sister! welcome
to our court, our kingdom, and our heart!” he said, holding
out both his hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Monsiegneur!” replied Madame. But as
she was embarrassed with the babe in her arms, she could
not accept his offered courtesy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, how then! is Madame, my sister, left without
her retinue? And has the Princess, my niece, no attendance?”
exclaimed Monsieur Henri, looking excessively
shocked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame the Duchesse de Berri had no more, when she
wandered in La Vendee!” said our Madame, demurely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, miserable country!—oh, unfortunate princes!” exclaimed
the old man, lifting his hands and raising his eyes
to heaven. Then—“Give me the illustrious babe,” he said;
and taking the child in his arms with the solemn air of a
bishop, who was about to baptize it, he called to one of his
negroes—“Come hither, Monsieur Louis.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A tall, aged man, with a very black skin, and very white
hair, who was clothed like the others, in a pink shirt and
white trousers, approached and bowed respectfully.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>“This is my High Constable of the Kingdom, Madame,”
said Monsieur De L’Ile, introducing the new-comer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then placing the infant solemnly in the arms of the old
negro, he charged him, saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Receive your Princess, Monsieur Louis! and bear her
on before us to the palace! I follow with Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Without suffering a muscle of his very intelligent face to
change, the old negro received the babe, and led the way
up the shaded avenue toward the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“August lady, and dear sister, will you accept my arm?”
said Monsieur Henri, bowing and offering his services with
the air of Chevalier Bayard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Monsiegneur,” said the ‘august lady,’ suffering
him to draw her arm within his own, and lead her
on, up the lovely, shadowy walk, through the shrubberies,
the pleasure grounds, and the flower gardens. There were
so many flowers! especially roses!—‘roses, everywhere
roses’—they flushed all the green island with their bloom,
and filled all the air with their perfume. They clustered
thicker as you approached the white house with its many
tall chimneys, and its central front portico. They climbed
its posts, and ran along its eaves and cornices, and shaded
its windows.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a beautiful, beautiful place!” said Madame, in
rapture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri led her up the white stone stairs of the
portico, through the front door, and into a broad central
hall from which several half-open doors on either side revealed
glimpses of many spacious rooms in their summer
array of straw matting, white curtains, linen covers, and
many flowers; while the wide open doors at the back of
the hall exposed a pleasant view of gardens, vineyards, and
orchards, sloping down to the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Welcome to my court, illustrious Madame,” said Monsieur
De L’Ile, opening the first door on his right, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>ushering his guest into a pleasant, airy parlor. He led her
to an arm-chair, placed her in it, and then rang for attendance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The bell was answered by the appearance of a handsome
and even very intellectual-looking mulatto woman, of about
thirty years of age, who courtesied and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is Mademoiselle Madeleine, the first lady of your
bed-chamber, Madame,” said Monsieur Henri, presenting
the woman to her new mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, Mademoiselle, conduct your august mistress
to her apartment. Monsieur Louis? Ah, you are there!
Deliver the Princess into the charge of Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The woman took the babe, and bowing to Madame, led
the way up stairs to a suite of apartments on the right side
of the central hall, whose many windows looked out upon
the beautiful pleasure grounds of the Island and upon the
surrounding sea, and whose summer furniture was arranged
with the nicest regard to comfort and elegance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My faith, the lunatic knows how to keep house,”
thought the lady. Then turning to her attendant, she inquired:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does your master ever become violent?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I ask you, does your master ever become ungovernable—dangerous?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon, I do not understand Madame,” said the
woman, gravely and respectfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <em>will</em> not, I suspect,” muttered the lady; then
aloud, she asked:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How long has your master been mad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon. Madame has been misinformed; my master
is not mad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your master is not mad!” exclaimed the lady, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Madame,” replied the mulatto, calmly.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>“You tell me that your master, Monsieur Henri De
L’Ile, is not mad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, if he is not mad, I should not wonder if you told
me next that he is King of the Isles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, Madame, he is King of the Isles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How? Your master, Monsieur De L’Ile, King of the
Isles?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly, Madame, since he says it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, then, since this is so, I see how it is. I have
arrived at Bedlam, and we are all lunatics together!” exclaimed
the visitor, highly provoked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has Madame any orders?” inquired the woman, humbly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; lay that child on the bed, and go and send Louis
to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madame.” And the woman left the room to do
her errand.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few moments, Louis appeared at the chamber door,
bowed and stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Louis, how long has your master been mad?” inquired
the lady, peremptorily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive, but Madame has been deceived; my master is
not mad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I suppose that he is really King of the Isles?”
questioned the guest, ironically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Undoubtedly, Madame, since he says.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he is not mad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I am, that is all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has Madame any orders?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—yes; tell Madeleine to return to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man bowed deeply and retired.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame clasped her temples with both hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” she said; “it is I, without doubt, who am mad,
or shall soon become so. Here I arrive at the extremity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>of the civilized world—the very jumping-off place, and
what do I find? a courtly madman, who calls himself King
of the Isles, and a pair of mulatto savages, who address me
in the elegantly turned phrases of the Tuileries, and confirm
his title——Ah, in a good hour! here comes Mademoiselle,
my maid of honor!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The entrance of the mulatto put an end to Madame’s
soliloquy, and suggested the propriety of arranging her
toilet. With the assistance of Madeleine, her black satin
dressing-gown was arranged, her well-dyed black ringlets
smoothed, the white lace collar and mits put on, and
Madame was ready to go down to breakfast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madeleine remained to take care of the child.</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis stood outside the door, bowed, and preceded the
lady to show her the way to the breakfast parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a delightful room on the right hand of the hall,
with its floor covered with straw matting. Its many muslin-draped
windows were open to a view of rolling green
meadows, covered with tender spring vegetation, and variegated
with apple, peach, and cherry trees, all in full bloom.
And beyond, the wide expanse of sparkling, leaping blue
water stretched away until its boundaries were lost under
the purple, crimson, and gold of the morning horizon.</p>

<p class='c013'>The breakfast table, covered with fine white damask, and
adorned with a service of silver and white Sevres, was laden
with all the luxuries of the season.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur De L’Ile (unless the reader prefers that I
should call him the King of the Isles) stood ready to hand
Madame to the table—an act of gallantry that he performed
with the stately courtesy of a Guise or a Medici.</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis took his stand at a sideboard that stood between
two of the open windows, and from whence he served
coffee, tea, or chocolate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame had enough to do to watch her host. She engaged
him in conversation, hoping to be able to measure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>the extent of his insanity, and to find out whether, and how
best, she could wrest from his aged hands the control of his
own property: first, whether she could not do it without
having <em>recourse</em> to law; secondly, whether she could do it
even <em>through</em> law. Of the first there was little hope; the
old man’s mind upon every subject but the one, acted with
a vigor, clearness, and directness that proved him to be a
very unlikely subject for even the most artful woman’s government;
of the second there was no certainty, for, though
upon one idea he was undoubtedly mad, yet, upon the first
suspicion of her purpose to subject him to a medical or a
judicial examination, he would assuredly have the cunning
to conceal his madness—a measure in which he would be
supported by his two educated slaves, Louis and Madeleine,
who, for whatever reason, were certainly flatterers of his
mania.</p>

<p class='c013'>However, Madame was not a woman rashly to resign a
purpose, or grow hopeless of its accomplishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>And all this time, while her head was busily brewing
plots, the old man, the purposed victim of her machinations,
was loading her with compliments and attentions.</p>

<p class='c013'>When breakfast was over, Madame set herself to arrange
her own personal attendance. Madeleine was retained as
her maid. And a pretty mulatto girl named Coralie, the
younger sister of Madeleine, was appointed nurse to the
“Princess Etoile.” Frivole, the boy brother of those girls
was brought from the garden into the house as page and
messenger. And Madame’s establishment was complete.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day was the Sabbath. Madame was a devout
Roman Catholic, and a scrupulous attendant upon mass.
Here was a difficulty not thought of before. Where and
how should she attend mass? She early rang her bell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her maid answered the summons.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madeleine, how far are we from the main land?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“About fifty miles.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>“Very good. How far is the nearest Catholic chapel
from this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“St. Inigoes, the nearest, Madame, is fifty miles.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better! Madeleine, my brother-in-law, your master,
his Majesty the King of the Isles, when he was simply Monsieur
Henri, used to be a good Catholic.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he is so still, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But good Catholics are under obligations to hear mass
once every Sunday.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Yes, Madame.’ It is very well to say, ‘Yes, Madame,’
but how upon earth do you reconcile the neglect of that
duty on the part of your master with your declaration that
he is still a good Catholic?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Madame will pardon me. She hastens to conclusions.
My master does not neglect his Christian
duties.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I should be glad to know how he performs them.
You do not mean to say that he goes fifty miles to hear
mass at St. Inigoes?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His Holiness the Pope offers up Mass here every Sunday,
before breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Eh?</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“His Holiness the Pope offers up Mass here every Sunday,
before breakfast, in the chapel fitted up for that purpose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! my head! my head!” cried the poor woman, wildly
clapping her hands to her temples.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is Madame ill?” coolly inquired the mulatto.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Ill?</span> Is all the world raving mad? You tell me, you
impertinent! you impudent! you insolent! outrageous——!
You tell me that the Pope says Mass here every
Sunday!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Madame can assure herself of that fact,” replied Madeleine,
with an humble, but injured look.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall go mad! I got over your King of the Isles,
your Lord High Constable, and your Princess Etoile—but
his Holiness the Pope saying Mass here every Sunday—no!
I won’t endure that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame undoubtedly has the privilege to object!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madame. But pardon me for delaying long
enough to say my master bade me inform you, that High
Mass would be celebrated in the chapel this morning;
and that Louis would be in attendance to conduct you
thither.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Begone, I say, while I have some rationality left!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stop! come back; help me to dress; I will go to the
chapel that the dream may be finished, and I may wake up
the sooner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Madeleiene obediently came back.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame quickly made her toilet and left her chamber,
at the door of which she found Louis waiting to attend
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Louis, is it true that Mass will be celebrated here this
morning?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But who will officiate?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our Most Holy Father, the Pope!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to the——. I mean go on before me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame had nearly permitted herself, in her indignation,
to use profane language.</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis, undisturbed by his mistress’s excitement, walked
down before her, until he paused before the door of the
chapel, which was one of those pleasant rooms on the first
floor.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>Madame entered, and found herself in an apartment fitted
up as a church.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the upper extremity stood an altar adorned with
sacred pictures and statuettes, wreathed with flowers, and
lighted with many wax candles. From a silver censer
burning before it, arose a rich aroma that filled the air.
Dark, rich transparencies pulled down before the windows
produced something of the effect of stained glass, and threw
over the scene an atmosphere at once brilliant and solemn.
Between every window was some picture of saint, or angel.
Rows of neat white benches supplied the place of pews. All
the slaves of the Island plantation, dressed in their summer
Sunday suits of pure white, were here assembled, with a
quiet and devout demeanor. Before the altar, with his
back to the congregation, stood a very tall and dignified
old man in the triple-crowned mitre and the pontifical
robes and vestments of his Holiness the Pope.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame sank into the nearest seat through the sheer exhaustion
produced by an overwhelming astonishment.
What did this mean? Who was this person? How dared
any subordinate priest, bishop, or archbishop, or even cardinal,
assume the pontifical robes?</p>

<p class='c013'>The strains of an organ now arose, swelling on the air.
She looked around—saw the organ, it was behind her, and
beside the door by which she had entered, but a screen
reaching half way up the instrument, concealed the organist
from her view. What <em>did</em> it all mean?</p>

<p class='c013'>But the Mass had commenced, and Madame was too devout
a Catholic to stop to think when it was time to pray.
So down she dropped upon her knees, and began in the
form of the ritual, and in her case, no doubt, with the exactest
truth, to accuse herself of every sin in the catalogue.
And in her devotions she forbore to look about or raise
her eyes again to the mysterious old man who officiated, at
the altar.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>At last at the conclusion of the solemnities, when the
celebrant turned round toward the people, and solemnly extending
his venerable hands, intoned “Deus Gratias,”
(Thanks be to God,) Madame raised her eyes, and to her
inexpressible scandalization, recognized Monsieur Henri.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good! This is better than the rest! He is a king
all the week and the Pope on Sunday. But it would be a
mortal sin in me to allow <em>this</em> madness to go on any longer!
I would put up with the king for six days, but the Pope,
Holy Virgin! no, that must be stopped. I’ll make an excuse
of an errand to town, get him to let me have a barque,
and go to the mainland, and to the County seat, and take
out a writ of lunacy against him. I will lose no time. I
will do this to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While Madame thus resolved, the congregation were
quietly dispersing. As there was but one outlet to this
room, the officiating priest himself came down; and in
passing by his guest, he paused, extended his hands over
her head in the most solemn and benignant manner, and
said, gravely and slowly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Benedicite, illustrious daughter,” and then in measured
steps passed out.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sunday, on the Sunrise Island, was a day of Heaven—as
the Isle itself was a terrestrial paradise.</p>

<p class='c013'>The fifty servants, entirely freed from labor at the time,
and dressed in their festive garments, wandered about with
their children, in couples, trios or groups—over the green
fields, beside the singing streams, or along the silvery
sanded beach; or they sat in groups under the shady
groves; or reposed, stretched at length, beneath some
gigantic tree; or gathered in some large arbor around some
one of their number, who had been taught to read, and who
read to them from the Book of books; or else they united
their voices in a psalm of thanksgiving that arose joyously
from that green and blooming Island of the sea, filling all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>the sunny air with music. And the lovely day was followed
by a moonlight night, and their Sabbath recreations
were closed by the assembling of the whole band of servants,
and the singing of an evening hymn. Then, after
partaking of the simple Sunday supper of coffee, cakes and
fruit, served under the trees, they separated for the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Monsieur Henri, no longer pope, but king, sat upon
his front piazza, with his niece upon his knee, his sister-in-law
beside him, and his two favorite servants Madeleine
and Louis near at hand, and watched the departing figures
of his people as they defiled off in twos and threes and
larger groups, toward their respective neat, white cabins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My subjects are happy, I think, my dear sister! At
least it is my study to make them so! And they love me!
Yes, they love me! That is what keeps my old age green,”
said the old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>And assuredly no people in the world were happier as a
community than these dependants of the good old man—these
subjects of a self-styled king.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They seem contented and prosperous,” said Madame.</p>

<p class='c013'>“They have nothing left to wish for, and on their side
leave me nothing to desire. Neither have I any cares of
government—Louis manages all my affairs,” said the old
man with a look of infinite content.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day, Monday, “His Majesty” requested a private
interview with his “august sister,” in which he begged
that she would give him a full and particular account of her
illustrious son, “the Prince,” his nephew’s misfortunes.
And Madame gave a distorted version of the truth—relating
that Monsieur Victoire had been condemned to the
colonies for conspiring in favor of the Bourbons, and that
his young wife, an English Lady of high rank, had abandoned
him in his misfortunes. The mind of the old man
in attending to this story seemed divided between exalted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>admiration for the heroism, and profound sorrow for the
misfortunes of his nephew.</p>

<p class='c013'>They then talked of the affairs of the Island. And Madame
learned from all she heard and saw, that Monsieur
Henri De L’Ile, notwithstanding his monomania, and perhaps
even <em>because</em> of it, was one of the best of masters
and wisest of rulers—truly deserving to be called by the
threefold titles that he claimed of King, Priest, and Father
of his people.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had, on first coming to the Island, found Louis and
Madeleine—a bright intelligent brother and sister, the former
twenty, the latter ten years of age. He had taught
them both to read, write, and keep accounts. They were
both perfectly devoted to his person and interests, and in
the twenty years of his residence on the Island, an attachment
had grown up between himself and them, that more
nearly resembled the confidential friendship of equals, than
the relative regard of master and servants. Yet their
reverential affection for their master amounted to idolatry.
No absurdity of which the old man through his monomania
might be guilty, could provoke from their respectful countenances
a smile. They seemed really to wish to believe
him to be a king, rather than to admit him to be a madman.
Never for an instant was their guarded reverence for him
surprised or betrayed. No matter how sudden, startling,
and perplexing the questions, put by Madame upon the
subject of their master’s madness—their answers were
always ready, grave, respectful, and uncompromising.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray, how long has it been since Monsieur Henri has
enjoyed the dignity of being a king all the week and a pope
on Sunday?” inquired Madame of Louis that identical
Monday morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To us, ever since he first announced himself as such, Madame,”
replied Louis, with an humble bow.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“Pray, has Monsieur Henri friends and neighbors on the
main land?” questioned the lady of Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very many, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And do they know that he is mad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They cannot know that since he is not, Madame,” replied
the woman deferentially.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Madame never could surprise either Louis or Madeleine,
or any other servant on the plantation into the
slightest betrayal of a suspicion that any thing was amiss
with their master’s brain.</p>

<p class='c013'>This brother and sister were the mainstays of their old
master. Louis managed his farm, orchard, vineyard, garden
and fishery, and attended to the sale of the products
of the whole. Madeleine kept his house, table and wardrobe
in order, and nursed him through any indisposition.
Madame saw at once that she herself was a supernumerary
in the establishment; that the position assigned to her was
that of a most honored guest, most welcome to remain forever,
but neither expected nor desired to take any trouble,
or assume any responsibility in the government of the
family. Now this position was by no means acceptable to
her feelings, and she resolved to carry into immediate execution
her purpose of going that day to the mainland to
apply for a writ of lunacy in behalf of her brother-in-law.
Having ascertained from Monsieur Henri that the Island
belonged to the County of Northampton, and that the
county-town was Eastville, she begged that he would allow
her the use of the barque and the men to work it to take
her to that town, where she said she wished to make some
purchases of summer clothing for herself and the child.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri, with the most cordial politeness, at
once assented, adding that he should do himself the honor
of attending his beloved sister.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now this was quite an unexpected difficulty. His presence
must defeat her object. She therefore begged that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>would not take the trouble to accompany her, and entreating
that he would regard his ease and health.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Monsieur De L’Ile was not to be exceeded in politeness.
He assured his sister-in-law that to attend
her to Eastville would afford him unmixed gratification.
And he further informed her that he himself had business
at the court-house, that required his immediate attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was therefore nothing for her to do but to submit
to necessity and trust to circumstances to favor her design.
And since he was really himself going to the court-house,
that very event might so turn out as to enable her, without
difficulty, to deliver him into the hands of the proper
authorities for his safe custody. She therefore affected to
accept his proffered services with great thankfulness.</p>

<p class='c013'>He informed her, however, that it would require a whole
day to go and return from Eastville, and that therefore, if
she pleased, he would give orders for the barque to be
made ready for service by sunrise next morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>To that feature of the plan, also, she assented with
seeming gratitude.</p>

<p class='c006'>How gloriously, the next day, arose the summer sun upon
that green and blooming and odoriferous island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame, from the rose-wreathed balcony of her front
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>chamber window, looked out upon the delightful scene, as
upon some poetic elysium, encircled by the crystal sea. It
was indeed an enchanting vision. The whole isle was carpeted
with a brilliant green verdure, sparkling with dew-drops,
and enameled with flowers of every elegant form and
beautiful color and delicious fragrance!—myriads upon
myriads of roses, rose-bushes, rose-trees, and rose-vines—roses
clustering, climbing, twisting and twining, everywhere—columns
and colonnades, piazzas, balconies, trellises, and
arbors, all wreathed and covered and vailed and festooned
with roses, that flushed all the green Isle with their intense
and vivid blushes, and filled the air with their rich aroma.
There were groves of ornamental trees of luxuriant beauty
and fragrance—the flowering almond with its delicate perfume,
and soft white blossoms, seeming as if a fall of summer
snow had lighted on its elegant tendrils; the lanton-belle
with its heavy shade and clustering purple tufts and
odoriferous breath; the red-bud with its brilliant green
foliage and scarlet-drops; the stately tulip-poplar, with its
fiery hanging bells; the queenly catalpa, with its aromatic
odor; the imperial magnolia, with its deep green,
shining leaves, and “all Arabia’s spices” in its pure white
vase-like cups; orchards of peach, apple, cherry, apricot
and plum-trees, all covered with their pink, white or variegated
flowers; walks flanked with raspberries, gooseberries,
and currant-bushes, all in full blossom. And lastly,
through the intervening branches of the fragrant flowering
locusts that overhung the silvery sanded beach, gleamed the
snow-white sails of the fairy barque, the “Sylph,” that fluttered
in the morning breeze like the wings of some beauteous
sea-bird—beyond this flashed and sparkled the deep
blue sea, and above all glowed the crimson, purple, and
golden glory around the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame had scarcely taken in this sublime, beautiful and
enchanting vision, when Louis rapped at the chamber door
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and announced that the breakfast, the boat, and his master,
all waited Madame’s pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>She descended to the breakfast parlor, where she found
the table spread, and Monsieur Henri equipped for his
journey.</p>

<p class='c013'>And after the morning meal of rich coffee, delicate bread,
fresh butter and eggs, and delicious fruit and cream, Monsieur
Henri announced himself as waiting the orders of
Madame, and gallantly conducted her to the barque.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Sylph was a beautiful sail-boat, gayly painted green
on the side, and white and red within. Her deck and ropes
and sails were clean and nice as a lady’s face and hands and
dress. From the mainmast streamed a snow-white pennant
studded with the golden lilies of France.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four negro sailors in neat straw-hats, blue shirts and
white trousers, stood on the deck waiting commands. They
doffed their hats to the master and to the lady, as the two
latter appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri assisted Madame to gain the deck, and
seated her in a comfortable willow-chair under a canopy in
the stern.</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis placed himself at the helm, the four sailors manned
the capstan, the anchor was weighed, the sails filled, and
the Sylph floated out upon the blue and sparkling water.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they sailed from the eastern extremity of the Island,
they were obliged to “’bout ship” and make half the circuit
of the Isle, in order to steer for the Northampton coast, that
lay off to the westward.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a delightful sail of three hours they came in sight
of the main land, with its rolling hills and valleys, and dark
green woods and meadows.</p>

<p class='c013'>A beautiful but solitary shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>No house in all its length to be seen save one—an old,
half-ruined, gray stone mansion, standing far out upon a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>point of land extending into the sea, and half hidden by
the ancient forest trees around it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is Brande’s Headland, where we are going ashore,”
said Monsieur Henri—walking forward and giving orders
to the men to strike sail and cast anchor where they were.</p>

<p class='c013'>A small skiff was then let down from the side of the
barque, Monsieur Henri and Madame got into it, followed
by Louis, who took the single oar and sculled rapidly toward
the beach, which they reached in a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur, still with the air of the Chevalier Bayard, or
the Grand Monarque, handed Madame from the boat, drew
her arm within his own, and with the aid of a gold-headed
cane, began to help himself and her up the rugged ascent
of the bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they reached its top, and stood upon a level with the
old, dilapidated house, some three or four wild looking,
handsome, healthy boys ran out to see who was coming.
Two great Newfoundland dogs that lay upon the broken,
stone steps, sprang up, but were immediately restrained by
the appearance of a very handsome, dark-haired girl, of
about thirteen years of age, who came to the front door,
and laying a hand on the head of each favorite, said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Down, Wind! Down, Wave! Behave, boys! How
dare you then? Don’t you see it’s Monsieur Henri?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The dogs, still growling, unwillingly submitted, and the
handsome brunette came down the old moss-grown steps to
meet her visitors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Welcome, Monsieur Henri! but you must forgive the
dogs; they know <em>you</em>, of course; it was the strange lady
they objected to,” said the brown maiden, extending her
hand to the old gentleman, who took and shook it cordially
and held it cozily, while he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Barbara, Barbara, still brighter than ever, my brave
girl! Why, what a woman you are growing! And how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>is the old skipper? Eh, Barbara? And the handsome
young mate? Eh, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The young girl laughed, displaying a row of the whitest
and evenest teeth in striking contrast with her cherry lips,
nut-brown skin, and sloe-black hair and eyes. She was too
young and guileless to blush at such a question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The skipper is off again? Eh, Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, sir, with a cargo of flour to Habana. He
will bring back West India sugar and molasses.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what a businesswoman you are, Babby. You
know all about every thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir!” exclaimed Barbara, laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And hark ye, Monsieur”—she said, mysteriously bending
toward him, and whispering so low that but the last
words of her communication were heard—“for Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Barbara, Barbara, you shocking little smuggler!
I ought to deliver you to the authorities.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, Monsieur. They are for Madame—the sweetmeats,”
said the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“For Madame? Very well. I have not presented you
to Madame. I must do so,” he said, taking her hand with
a droll formality, turning her about facing the lady, and
continuing:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame L’Orient, my sweetheart, Barbarie, the daughter
of my brave Captain Brande, who owns and commands
the good brig Kelpie, trading between this coast and the
West Indies, the Bermudas, South America, England—anywhere.
Ma belle Barbarie used to sail with the skipper
in all his voyages, but now she stays home and takes care
of the boys, while her father is at sea, and does a little in
the smuggling line when he comes home—do you not?” he
asked, playfully, chucking the girl under the chin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—no, Monsieur!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mon Dieu! she has a hamper or so of West India sweetmeats
hidden away, that has never seen the outside of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>custom-house! but she does not dabble in smuggling! <em>she</em>
does not! Eh, bien! She says they are for Madame, and
we will excuse her and thank her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will Monsieur and Madame come in and rest?” asked
the maiden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, my child—but can you let us have the old
carry-all? We are going on to Eastville?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, Monsieur! Will you want me to drive?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my child; I have Louis with me, and if I had not—death
of my life! do you suppose I would sit back at my
ease, and allow you to hold the reins?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monsieur is very polite, but he knows that I am accustomed
to drive passengers from the coast to Eastville.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not when they are gentlemen, my pretty one! But,
now! how soon can we have that carriage ready?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you and Madame will walk in and sit down, I will
put the horses to it directly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By no means, my little one! Direct my servant, Louis,
where to find them—he will do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, Monsieur,” said the girl, laughing, “if you patronize
our house much, you will spoil me! I shall forget
the use of my hands, and permit them to grow soft and
white, like a lady’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The gallant young mate of the Kelpie will not object to
that, my beauty!” said the old gentleman, who, looking
around and seeing Louis coming up the bank, beckoned him
to approach, and directed him to go to the stables, get the
carriage out, put the horse to it and bring it around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis bowed and went off toward a dilapidated pile of
grey stone buildings, at some distance behind the dwelling-house,
and which had probably long ago deserved the name
of stables.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the visitors declined going into the house, Barbara
ran in to bring out chairs for them.</p>

<p class='c013'>While she was gone, Madame, looking around upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>desolate scene, and contrasting it mentally with the lovely
island they had that morning left, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a ruinous, dilapidated old place! How can the
owner allow a fine property like this to go to ruin?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I don’t know! My good friend, Captain Brande,
is fit for nothing but the waters! he nor his race! He belongs
to that class of old sea dogs that have infested these
coasts ever since their first settlement, and before! He
married the heiress of all this property—Barbara’s mother;
she died, leaving him with Babby and her three little
brothers. Babby has been a housekeeper for the father,
and a mother for the children, which is as much as can be
expected of her, poor child! But you see how the skipper
has allowed the house to go to wreck and ruin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But do you tell me”—asked Madame—“do you mean
to say that this young maiden stays here with these children
day and night, without protection, in this most lonely and
desolate of places?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not quite; she has two faithful negro servants, an old
married pair, whom she calls Neptune and Amphitrite.
And then, those dogs! Either of those beasts could spring
at a strong man’s throat and drag him to the earth!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what is that about the smuggling?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, my little Barbara takes after her salt-water progenitors,
who, with charity let it be said, were all free-traders,
except those who were pirates!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ugh! and this young creature resembles them!” said
Madame, in holy horror.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot say that she does in the matter of their piratical
propensities;—but as for their buccaniering proclivities,—I
tell you this young thing has such a keen relish for
free-booting, that a smuggled aloe would seem sweeter to
her taste than the sweetest orange that had paid duty!
The little villain! she whispered me just now, that she had
a hundred canisters of West India sweetmeats, that were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>not one of them flavored with custom-house! The little
scamp! how she loves the sea besides! Just to see her
black eyes kindle when she speaks of a ship! If she were
a boy, she would run away and go to sea; being a girl,
with her propensities and in her circumstances, I don’t
know what will become of her! Hush! don’t reply, here
she is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara came out, bringing two chairs, which she placed
for her visitors. Then, while they seated themselves, she
ran away again, and returned, bringing a little table,
which she set before them, and covered with a white cloth.
And then, in two or three successive flittings into the
house, she brought out the whitest bread and freshest butter,
the clearest guava jelly, and the most fragrant pineapple
preserves; and lastly, a bottle of wine, that Monsieur
Henri lifted up and gazed upon in consternation, exclaiming,
when he had somewhat recovered his suspended
breath—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, you little audacious! don’t you know, then, that
this wine is never, <em>never</em> exported; that it is tantamount
to high treason, even if it be not high sacrilege, to send it
out of Italy! Why this is the Pope’s own particular
drink! How dared you? Where did you get it from?
You perceive that I am asking you questions, Mademoiselle!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The girl laughed merrily, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try it, Monsieur! try it! Try it, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not until you have told me where you got it! You
perceive that I have no politeness; I persist in my questions,
Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My father brought it from the Levant, when he came
home from his last voyage, Monsieur,” said Barbara,
laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And of course every custom-house officer between there
and here has drawn the cork, and inhaled the perfume?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>“<em>Oh of course!</em> and tasted the contents and smacked his
lips over it—<em>of course they have!</em>” exclaimed Barbara,
laughing gayly, and clapping her hands in glee.</p>

<p class='c013'>The luxurious little luncheon was discussed, and by the
time they had finished, Louis brought the carriage around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri handed his sister-in-law into the back
seat, and placed himself beside her. Louis took the front seat,
gathered up the reins, and prepared to drive on. Monsieur
and Madame then took leave of their young hostess, and
the carriage started.</p>

<p class='c013'>The road to Eastville lay through a thick pine woods,
and the ride would have been a very pleasant one but for
Madame’s anxious thoughts, that kept her silent, and threw
a little gloom over the whole party.</p>

<p class='c013'>We know what Madame L’Orient’s intentions were in
coming to the main land this day; namely, to obtain a writ
of lunacy against her kind-hearted old host, and a power of
guardianship over his person and property. But was ever
a woman so unfortunate as herself? she asked. For no
sooner had she brought this old man away from the island
than his insanity seemed to have dropped from him, as a
garment, and he spoke and acted as rationally as any one,—with
no air à la Grand Monarque, no talk of crowns and
sceptres, thrones and kingdoms; but with the gay and genial
manners of an old French “good fellow.” What was the
meaning of it? Was that delightsome island, an enchanted
spot, that infected its owner with the proud madness of
an imaginary monarchy? And was he at once, on quitting
its shores, delivered from the spell. It really seemed so.</p>

<p class='c013'>On emerging from the pine woods, after an hour’s drive,
they arrived at the little hamlet of Eastville, then a small
cluster of houses, built around the court-house on the cross
roads.</p>

<p class='c013'>They drove first to the village stores, that Madame
might do her ostensible errand of shopping.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>And when this was over, and the little packages of linen,
muslin, thread and needles, made up and put into the carriage,
Madame and Monsieur re-entered, took their seats
and drove to the court-house, where the court was in session
and the judiciary officers all at their posts. Monsieur
De L’Ile’s business there was simply to pay his taxes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame watched in vain for an opportunity of denouncing
him as a lunatic. There was none afforded. His conversation
upon all subjects—property, agriculture, manufactures,
commerce, politics—with the various persons with
whom he happened to fall in company, was so strong, so
clear, so pointed and conclusive,—evincing an intellect so
profound, powerful, and almost prophetic, that to have
hinted at the possibility of his being a lunatic, would have
been to expose herself to the certainty of being pronounced
a maniac or an impostor. In a word, Madame felt herself
constrained to defer her purpose to some more favorable
opportunity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur Henri concluded his business, and they turned
their horses’ heads shoreward.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was near sunset when they reached the headland and
Barbara Brande’s old ruined house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara had tea ready for them. The table was set out
under a great elm tree, and covered with imported, if not
smuggled luxuries, such as guava jellies, anchovy paste,
potted meats, etc., which Barbara exultingly declared had
never been spiced with duty.</p>

<p class='c013'>After tea they took leave of their bright, young hostess,
and returned on board their barque. They sailed homeward
by moonlight and arrived at early bed time.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this, Madame made many similar attempts to convict
her benefactor of mania; but always without success;
for though as long as Monsieur Henri De L’Ile confined
himself to the island, he was for six days of the week a king,
and on the seventh a pope, yet just so soon as he left its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>shores, or received any one from the outside world upon its
soil, he became a plain, cheerful, clear-headed country gentleman,
whom it would have been madness to charge with
lunacy. But whether on the isle or off it, whether king or
countryman, Monsieur Henri ever remained the same great,
generous, warm-hearted host, friend and master, dispensing
happiness to all who lived on his lovely isle, beneath his
benignant rule.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And so, as the sunny summers slipped away, in this
atmosphere of love and beauty, Etoile, the peerless little
“Princess of the Isle,” budded from infancy into childhood.
She was as lovely as the loveliest vision that ever visited a
poet in his most inspired dreams. The inside of a shell was
not more pearly white, or flushed with a more delicate rose
tint, than her fair, transparent complexion; the yellow silk
of the young corn no more golden bright than her shining
ringlets; nor the modest violet of a deeper, purer blue than
her heavenly eyes. Yet blonde, as she was, her fair face
was a “softened image” of a <em>dark ladye</em> whom we have seen
before. It was as if a dainty miniature had been copied in
water colors from a fine portrait in India ink. The fair and
roseate face of Etoile was, in fact, a delicate transcript of
the beautiful dark face of her mother, Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The life of this lovely child on the delightful Island
passed like a heavenly dream. It was even brighter with
enchanting illusions than the usual life of childhood. She
was taught to believe that the stately and benignant old
gentleman, her grand-uncle, was indeed a king; that she
herself was in reality a princess, and that the Sunrise Island
was her hereditary kingdom. “Within the Island’s calm
retreat she lived a sort of charmed life,” never leaving her
beautiful home, never even desiring to leave it. In the
pleasant mansion her education was conducted by Monsieur
Henri, who instructed her in what are called the solid
branches of education, and by Madame, who gave her lessons
in music, dancing, and embroidery. Out of the mansion,
by Monsieur Henri’s express commands, she was left
to herself and to nature. Here she lived at liberty in a
paradise, the influence of whose beneficent beauty must forever
have saved her graceful wildness from breaking into
unseemly rudeness. Here she played and frolicked with the
innocent freedom of the squirrel, or the bird—going up into
the tops of the beautiful grove trees if their umbrageous
branches wooed her presence—and learning to climb as the
kitten learns; or in her own retired haunts, bathing in the
blue waters of the sea until her limbs grew familiar with the
waves, and she learned to breast them, as the young swan
learns to swim. Thus her physical organization was in the
fairest way of a full and beautiful development.</p>

<p class='c013'>And if this star-bright Etoile was taught to believe herself
a princess, she was the no less instructed to consider her position
a high and holy trust for the welfare and happiness of
those soon to be dependent on her. Nor were these instructions
so very far from the truth as at first view they might
appear. For, if this lovely girl were not indeed the princess,
she was certainly the <em>heiress</em>, and would be the <em>absolute
mistress</em> of the Island and of the people upon it, over whom
she would possess more than a queen’s power, and for whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>she would also feel more than a queen’s responsibility. And
so the young creature felt it. No selfish, thoughtless, childish
exactions, ever embittered the unvarying sweetness of
her manners to “those who labored in her fields, or waited
in her halls.” No harsh tone ever jarred the harmony of
her voice in speaking to them. No dark frown ever clouded
the brightness of her face in looking upon them. And just
as surely nothing but smiles and blessings and devoted service
were hers, from those affectionate creatures.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame was anxious to disabuse the growing girl of her
royal imaginations; but Monsieur was resolved to preserve
her proud and beautiful illusions. And the only occasion
upon which Monsieur was ever known to give way to furious
passion, was one morning when he happened to overhear
Madame inform Etoile that, so far from being a
princess, she was only a miserable little beggar, dependent
upon the bounty and caprices of her grandfather, who, far
from being a king, was only a wretched old lunatic.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon hearing this, Monsieur Henri burst like a storm
into the room, and striking his heavy cane upon the floor,
roared forth in a voice of thunder:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Woman!!</span> I have borne much from your ingratitude
and deception! But dare again to doubt the royal descent
of your princess, and you shall pay for your treason
with your <span class='fss'>HEAD</span>!!”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was an awful pause.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Madame!</span> do you hear?” thundered the old infuriate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame <em>did</em> hear, and turned whiter than the handkerchief
that she pressed to her bloodless lips, while her eyes
dilated with terror until a white circle flared around their
black balls. But she was past the power of speech, and
could only gaze panic-stricken after the old man, as he
haughtily strode from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh-h-h! Mon Dieu, what a situation!” exclaimed Madame,
when she had recovered her breath—“the old beast!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>the old madman! the horrible old ogre! Bon Dieu!
what bewitched me to come here and put myself in his
power! Grand Dieu! and I am out of the reach of human
help! Oh Ciel! if he should take it into his crazy brain
that I am plotting, he would—off with my head in the
twinkling of an eye! Don’t I know he would? And this
yellow demon of a Louis, who never gainsays him, whether
he claims to be king or pope, would do it for him! Mon
Dieu! Mon Dieu! what is to become of a poor woman,
whom her evil fate has committed to the care of a furious
madman!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And half-crazy with fear, Madame seized the bell-rope,
and rang a peal that presently brought Louis hurrying to
the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you ring, Madame?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! I should think I did. It is you I want! you!
Come here! Tell me now—supposing that old madman
were to take it into his precious head to order an execution,
what would you do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame, pardon, I do not comprehend. I know no
madman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Diable! Suppose, then, that my brother-in-law, your
master, his majesty the King of the Isles, were to order
you to cut off the head of a fellow-servant, what should
you do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should obey him, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You would? Well, suppose he were to command you
to decapitate a member of his own family?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should do it, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you would deserve to be hanged,” cried the lady,
breaking out into a cold sweat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis bowed respectfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And—supposing it were even my own head?” she
gasped.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should have to take it off, honored Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>“Mon Dieu, I shall go crazy! Begone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Louis bowed deeply and retired.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame sank back in her chair, pressing her handkerchief
to her panic-stricken and ghastly face.</p>

<p class='c013'>And from that day forth, Madame L’Orient never felt
her life, for an instant, secure from the caprices of a madman.
She ceased entirely to plot “against the peace and
dignity of the king,” and only thought of the best means of
securing her personal safety until she could make her escape
from the Isle.</p>

<p class='c013'>She wished above all things to return to Paris, where
she hoped that her “misfortunes,” as she called her <em>sins</em>,
were by this time forgotten. But to go to Paris and reside
there comfortably required much money, and though
Monsieur Henri was the soul of generosity, she doubted in
this instance whether he would think proper to advance
what she would consider sufficient funds. However, she
broke the matter to him, and found Monsieur Henri very
willing to aid her with money to the full extent of her desires.
But when she mentioned her wish to take her grandchild
Etoile to Paris, Monsieur Henri struck his cane upon
the ground, which was his form of taking an oath, and
swore that the “princess” should never depart from the
Island, but should remain to have her education completed
at his court. At length, terrified and worn out, Madame
consented to leave the little girl behind.</p>

<p class='c013'>A very favorable opportunity offered for her voyage.
Captain Brande, in his fine new clipper, the “Mercury,”
was lying off the Headland, shipping a cargo of tobacco,
preparatory to setting sail for Havre. A passage was
engaged for Madame L’Orient.</p>

<p class='c013'>And accordingly on a fine day in June, Madame bade
adieu to her little granddaughter, and gallantly attended
by Monsieur Henri, went on board the pretty Sylph, and
sailed for the Mercury, lying off the headland. A three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>hours’ run before the wind carried them alongside the clipper,
where they learned that owing to a delay in the shipment
of a portion of the lading, she would not weigh
anchor until the next tide. There was nothing for Monsieur
Henri to do then, but to take Madame to the house
of Barbara Brande, to wait a few hours for the sailing of
the clipper.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old house on the Headland was more ruinous and
more clumsily mended than ever.</p>

<p class='c013'>The black-haired, bright-eyed, bare-footed boys had
grown into fine lads.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Barbara had ripened into a buxom brunette, with a
finely developed form, hair like the purple-black sheen of
the falcon’s wing, and eyes like his glance when flying
toward his prey. A splendid creature was this wild sea-coast
maiden; and Madame, who appreciated beauty in the
physique, gazed upon her in unqualified admiration as she
stood upon the bluff to welcome them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Walk up, Monsieur; walk up, Madame. I am so
happy to see you,” she said, smiling and clapping her
hands with all her former childish glee. “Walk up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it is all very well for you to keep on repeating
‘walk up,’ and ‘walk up,’ when one had as well attempt to
‘walk up’ the side of a perpendicular wall,” said the old
man, ruefully; and with his right hand he planted his cane
as a sort of grappling hook, and with his left arm dragged
the weight of Madame up the toilsome, steep ascent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give <em>me</em> your hand, madame,” said Barbara, laughingly
stooping and extending hers to the lady, who seized it and
nearly pulled her good-humored assistant down before
gaining the top of the ascent. But Barbara possessed
a firm foot and a strong hand, and safely hoisted her
charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Grand Ciel!” exclaimed Madame, panting after the
performance of this feat.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>They went on to the house, ascended the rickety stairs
of the portico, and entered the large, cheerful hall. Four
spacious rooms, two on each side, opened into this hall.
This story was the only habitable part of the house. Barbara
turned the latch of the first door to the left, and admitted
her guests into a large but scantily-furnished parlor,
without carpet or curtains, with only a dozen black oak
chairs, a black oak table, and an engraved portrait of Paul
Jones over the mantle-piece. This was the most comfortable
and best furnished room in the house. Barbara seated her
guests, brought them refreshments, and excused herself,
and went into the adjoining hall to resume her occupation—the
packing of a last trunk for her eldest brother, John,
now a fine boy of sixteen, who was going out in the Mercury
to make his first voyage. While Barbara packed the
trunk, the old man watched her through the open door,
launching at her laughing head an occasional jest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my pretty Barbara, so John is going to sea?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Going to see <em>what</em>, Monsieur?” mocked the merry
maiden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! n’importe! but tell me, pretty Barbara, is the
handsome young mate going on this trip?”</p>

<p class='c013'>This time the girl was putting forth so much strength to
force an unmanageable package into the trunk, that it
threw the blood to her face in torrents of crimson, and she
remained silent. And Monsieur Henri did not press the
question.</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur and Madame stayed and dined with Barbara;
and in the afternoon the old gentleman attended his sister-in-law
to the Mercury, saw her comfortably ensconced in her
cabin, took leave of her there, and returned to his barque.
In going home, he touched at the Headland, and went on
shore for a moment to ask Barbara a question alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now tell me, bright Barbara” he said, “is the handsome
mate going this trip?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Well, he is, Monsieur. He is inseparable from my
father—he is his right-hand man, as the saying is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I did not see him aboard ship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is on the main, hurrying up some hogsheads of tobacco,
that are to go on board.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! Well, when is it to be, my pretty Barbara?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, Monsieur?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! let us have no secrets between you and me, my
girl!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Monsieur, I do not mind telling you alone,” said
the young girl, blushing brightly, while she answered
frankly—“When he returns from his present voyage, Monsieur,
my father will give up the command of the Mercury
to him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who will then become his son-in-law.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara blushed, smiled, and nodded assent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And your brother, John?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He makes his first voyage now; afterward he will be
mate to Julius.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will he? I thought it was John’s <em>sister</em> who was to
be mate to Julius?” said the old man slyly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara crimsoned, then laughed aloud, and admitted:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish it could be so! I do so <em>long</em> to go to sea; my
heart has gone there often.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After Julius?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before I ever saw or heard of Julius,” said the girl, in
slight displeasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I know it, I know it, my girl! You must pardon
the jests of an old man who takes a father’s interest in you.
Good-night, my dear; good-night,” said Monsieur Henri
cordially shaking her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night, dear Monsieur Henri.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Monsieur De L’Ile turned to depart. The inquiries he
had put to Barbara Brande were not the idle questions of
gossip. He took, as he said, a father’s interest in the fortunes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>of this motherless girl, and had a private plan of his
own for forwarding the prosperity of herself and her betrothed.
He re-entered his barque, and sailed home by
starlight. And the next day, with the first tide, the Mercury
weighed anchor, and set sail for Havre.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madame, after a prosperous voyage of five weeks, arrived
at Havre, and traveled post to Paris. She reached
that capital a few weeks previous to the arrival of her son,
Victoire, with whom she thus soon had the happiness of
being reunited.</p>

<p class='c013'>She accompanied him to England when he proceeded
thither to claim his bride as has been shown.</p>

<p class='c013'>And when he failed in this enterprise, she recommended
him to file a petition for a hearing before the Spiritual
Court of Arches, to place the affair in the hands of a competent
attorney to manage during his absence, and then to
embark for America, and take up his residence with his
uncle, the pleasant old madman, who fancied himself King
of the Isles; but who would nevertheless receive his nephew
with open arms. Madame also resolved to accompany her
son and re-establish herself on the Island, where she felt that
with Victoire by her side, she should be perfectly safe.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon inquiring at St. Catherine’s docks she found her
old acquaintance, Captain Brande, with his clipper the
Mercury, about to sail for the Chesapeake, and gladly
availed herself of the opportunity afforded to secure a passage
for herself and son.</p>

<p class='c013'>They embarked the same night and set sail the next
morning.</p>

<p class='c013'>And from the hour of their embarkation, Monsieur Victoire’s
spirits had sunk, as I said, until they had reached
the point of despair. A presentiment of approaching death
overshadowed him. A necessity of putting in order his
earthly affairs weighed upon him. And it was under the
influence of this feeling that he pressed his friend Julius
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Luxmore to accept the guardianship of his young daughter,
and executed a testament leaving her to his charge, which
he placed in Mr. Luxmore’s keeping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If I survive, Luxmore,” he said, “I shall find Estelle,
inform her of the existence of her child, and through that
child constrain her to my will. If I die, Luxmore, you are
to take charge of Etoile, advise her mother of her existence,
but make Estelle’s eternal separation from Montressor
the only condition of the restoration of her child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I promise to execute your will, and to do all else that
you desire. Nevertheless, I must assure you that your talk
of death is an absurdity that proves you to be a hypochondriac,”
said Julius Luxmore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Victoire shook his head, and dropped into a mournful
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>And three weeks after that conversation, the Mercury
was wrecked as we have shown, and all on board were lost
except Julius Luxmore, who being rescued by Lord Montressor,
and carried on board the Queen Charlotte, and
finding there no one who knew him, gave his name, for
reasons of his own, as Julius Levering.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the strong box that had been picked up from the
wreck of the Mercury, he found the will of Victoire
L’Orient, and carefully secured it.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the Queen Charlotte had reached the port of
Baltimore, and the mournful intelligence of the wreck of
the Mercury went abroad to spread grief and terror over
the land, it was also said that every soul on board perished,
except one Mr. Levering, whom no one seemed to know,
and who, in fact, had disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>And oh! as the dreadful story of the loss of the Mercury,
with all but one on board, spread over the land, how many
homes were darkened, how many hearts made desolate.
The awful intelligence, traveling slowly through cities,
towns, and villages, at length reached Eastville, reached the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>Headland and Barbara Brande. And upon that home the
news fell like a thunderbolt, smiting it to ruin! For all
was gone!—ship and cargo and crew!—father, brother,
and lover! All gone at a stroke! All lost, except this
Mr. Levering whom no one knew, but whom Lord Montressor
had risked his life to save!</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We left the beautiful Estelle a fugitive from love over
the wide world.</p>

<p class='c013'>We left Lord Montressor anxiously seeking some clue
by which to trace her course.</p>

<p class='c013'>We bade adieu to the “Island King” and “Princess,”
leaving them together in their insulated kingdom.</p>

<p class='c013'>We parted company with Julius Levering at the moment
that he disappeared from the deck of the ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>And finally we abandoned the poor, wounded, young
lioness, Barbara Brande, in the hour of her utmost need,
when every earthly stay and support was stricken from her
at one blow.</p>

<p class='c013'>We return first to Barbara. She was of a stronger,
firmer, more resolute and courageous nature than any woman,
or than most men. Yet when the blow fell—the blow
that deprived her at once of father, brother, lover, living,—all
in an instant, she dropped beneath it, sunk as it were
smitten to the earth!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>I have seen a Titanic forest tree struck with lighting before
my window—seen it suddenly by a shaft from Heaven,
rived, branch, and trunk, and root, from sky to earth!</p>

<p class='c013'>So fell the thunderbolt of fate upon her! riving, rending,
scathing, brain and heart and frame! and dropped under it,
prostrate.</p>

<p class='c013'>But she was strong and could not die—she was a human
soul and could not lie prostrate and immovable forever, as
the thunder-stricken tree laid!</p>

<p class='c013'>The energetic spirit soon struggled to free itself from the
serpent coils of pain and death, and longed to hurl itself
amid some violent, some tempestuous, terrible action, in
which the sense of anguish might be lost.</p>

<p class='c013'>She conquered the agony—she surmounted it as we do
every thing in this world! Yes, she surmounted it; but the
world was changed, or she was!</p>

<p class='c013'>Life never seemed the same to her again. All seemed
dull, flat, spiritless. She was weary of the careless round
of days and nights; weary of the monotonous rising and
setting of the sun; weary of the unmeaning, unsympathising
faces of men and women; disgusted with the regular
recurrence of three meals a day, disgusted with all the
eaters and drinkers, workers and sleepers, buyers and sellers
in this tedious, insufferable world!</p>

<p class='c013'>In such a mood of mind, many men and women have
gone mad; but Barbara Brande’s brain was too strong and
healthy to permit her to lose her consciousness of suffering
in madness.</p>

<p class='c013'>In such a mood many have committed suicide—but
Barbara Brande, untutored child of the sea as she was, and
driven to despair as she had been, possessed too deep a
reverence for the laws of God and his holy gift of life, to
cast that life away and rush unbidden into the awful presence
of the Giver!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>So she struggled bravely to free her spirit from the writhing,
binding, fettering serpents of anguish and despair!</p>

<p class='c013'>Her heart panted to lose its dreadful sense of loss in
action! Oh, action! action! action! Such action as that
into which despairing man hurls himself, and forgets his
despair; struggling, laborious, dangerous action! Strife,
battle, war!—war with circumstance, with man, with the
elements!</p>

<p class='c013'>With such irresistible impulses, women have sometimes
enlisted as soldiers—aye, and won laurels, too, in the fields
of victory; but Barbara Brande, with all her strength, and
fire, and courage, and her passionate desire to stun the
maddening consciousness of anguish in some stormy conflict
and career—could not have done any thing like this.
Her maiden modesty would not have permitted her to
change her woman’s dress for that of man, any more than
her native truthfulness would have allowed her to practice
a deception in regard to her sex. And her free, wild, ungovernable
spirit could no more have submitted to the control
of camp discipline, than her merciful heart could have
taken part in the bloodshed of the battle-field.</p>

<p class='c013'>So, though the wounded, tortured, maddened young
creature thought of this, she could not enter upon such a
life.</p>

<p class='c013'>A stricken lioness, with the arrow quivering in her flesh,
lays not down in patient suffering, but runs roaring,
through the desert, until the shaft falls from the wound, or
she drops dead!</p>

<p class='c013'>So Barbara! she longed to propel herself headlong into
some stormy, stunning strife!</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile two boy brothers of eleven and twelve looked
up in her face for comfort and support,—looked up to the
brave and gentle sister, who was also the only mother they
had ever known.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sister, sister! do not stare so! You frighten us to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>death with your eyes!” they said, as they came to her
where she sat, in the dreary, half-furnished old parlor, <em>her</em>
chamber of desolation!</p>

<p class='c013'>They were kneeling each side of her, with their heads
upon her lap. Her arms were around each boy, her face
bent over them, and her wild black hair all unbound, and
streaming around them. She might have seemed a widow
with her orphans. But she was even a more desolate creature—this
awfully bereaved maiden with her little brothers.
For a widow has generally some knowledge of life and
some experience to meet its exigencies; but what does a
poor, wild girl, thunder-stricken, maddened, blinded, by
such overwhelming calamity, know of battling the watch
with fate?</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing!</p>

<p class='c013'>There she sat—her arms around the boys’ heads—her
face bent over them, her dark hair streaming.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sister, don’t look so! Oh, sister, speak to us!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my boys, my boys! what shall sister say to you!
What can sister do for you? Oh, lads, the best thing we
could do would be to put to sea in a leaking boat and go
down with the others!—only that the Lord forbids such!”
she cried, wildly clasping them to her heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, sister! don’t think of such a thing as that!
We don’t want to die at all,” said Edwy, the younger
boy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The elder, Willful, said nothing, but gazed with unspeakable
love in his sister’s face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, boys, boys! your sister will turn to a pillar of salt
if she stays here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, <em>don’t</em> stay here, Barbara! get the insurance-money
and buy a vessel, and let us lade it and make a voyage to
Habana,” said Willful, gazing earnestly into his sister’s
face.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the first time Barbara lifted her lion-like head,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>shaking her black hair as a mane from her breast—her
great, strong eyes kindled, her nostrils quivered, as those
of a steed that scents the battle afar off—she drew in
a deep breath and exclaimed, in a quick, low, resolute
tone—</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s it! I have found it! You are right, Willful,
my brother! Our father’s craft must be ours.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You feel better now, sister?” said the gentle-spirited
Edwy, putting his arm around her neck and kissing her
cheek—“you feel better?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!—thank God.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you won’t any more talk about putting to sea in a
leaking boat?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—Heaven forbid!”</p>

<p class='c013'>From this time Barbara’s spirits rallied. She looked
around upon her circumstances, prospects, and duties, and
her facilities for meeting the future.</p>

<p class='c013'>First, what were her duties?</p>

<p class='c013'>Her brothers looked to her for support, comfort and
guidance. She had always filled a mother’s position toward
them. She must also now occupy a father’s place.</p>

<p class='c013'>How should she properly discharge these obligations?</p>

<p class='c013'>Her father’s last will and testament, besides endowing
her with half the small property, constituted her the whole
executor of that will and the guardian of her brothers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The property consisted of the wild, unproductive farm
and half-ruined house on the headland—an unprofitable but
an inalienable estate, that would just bring garden vegetables
and grain enough for family use; there were three or
four negroes who worked the garden, and sometimes, when
the Skipper had been short of hands, worked the ship.
Besides this, there was the insurance-money of the ship and
cargo that had also been assigned to Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Looking over, and mentally appraising her property, her
peculiar temperament, talents and circumstances, Barbara’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>resolution was soon formed, and carried out. She determined
to go to Baltimore, purchase a clipper, and lade it,
take her negro sailors and her two brothers, and sail
for the West Indies, to open a trade with her father’s old
correspondents.</p>

<p class='c013'>Accordingly, leaving the house and her little brothers in
the care of the negroes, Barbara took passage in the first
passing vessel for Baltimore, where in a few days she
arrived safely.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the usual demur and delay, she succeeded in getting
the whole of the insurance-money, and then she set out in
search of a clipper. She was fortunate in having a choice
of three, and went about the work of inspecting them with
a perfectly composed and competent manner, and astonished
the grizzled old skippers of the port, by pronouncing the
first unseaworthy; the second, very little if any better; and
by ordering certain very judicious alterations and repairs to
be made upon the third, which she finally decided on purchasing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who the deuce have we here? What the demon sort
of a girl is this, who knows all parts of a ship as well as she
does the chambers and cupboards in her mother’s house,
and disputes about the build and rigging of a craft with the
oldest ‘salt’ among us? aye! and can work a ship, I have
no doubt in the world, as well as the best mate we have!”
said one grey old sea-captain to another.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! she <em>is</em> an ‘old salt,’” replied the other, “as <em>old</em> a
<em>salt</em> as so <em>young</em> a <em>girl</em> can be! That is old Brande’s
daughter, he who was lost on the Mercury. I suppose she
is about twenty-one or twenty-two years of age, and Brande
used to take her to sea with him from the time she was five
years old! So Barbara may have seen fifteen years of sea-service,
for aught I know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what is she going to do with the clipper she has
purchased?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>“Ah! Lord knows! Give one of her brothers the command
of it, I suppose, if she has one grown up and capable
of taking it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While the old skippers took “the bearings,” of her course,
Barbara, quite undisturbed by the opinions and comments
of others, completed her purchase, and left the wharf.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same week, Barbara returned home to place affairs
in order there before going to sea. She arranged the old
house, and left it, together with the garden and the stock,
in care of old Neptune and his wife, with whom also
she left a small sum of money for their incidental expenses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Having made all preparations, accompanied by her two
brothers and attended by her negro sailors, young Neptune
and Ignatius, two stalwart sons of the old couple left in
care of the house, Barbara embarked in an up-bay packet
for Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very profound was the astonishment of her old acquaintances,
the skippers, when they discovered that Barbara herself
would take command of her own vessel. Their surprise
would have been greater still, perhaps, if they had known
how thoroughly competent in all respects was this eagle-eyed,
lion-hearted maiden for the task!</p>

<p class='c013'>She was fitted for the position by nature, constitution,
and disposition, for she was a girl of great personal strength,
courage, and activity, with a profound passionate attraction
toward a sea life.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was prepared for it by education and habit; for in
the dozen voyages she had made with her father, the old
skipper had thoroughly instructed her in the theory and
practice of the science of navigation, and the art of seamanship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally, she was compelled to it by circumstances. She
had not only to support her young brothers but to put them
in a way of supporting themselves. Their hereditary attractions,
like her own, were to the sea; and no life offered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>such facilities to her and to them, as the life of the merchant-service.
Last and not least, her negro sailors, like
their mistress and her brothers, loved the ocean, and knew
how to do nothing else so well as to work a ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus being fitted for a sea life by nature; being prepared
for it by education; and driven to it by circumstances,
we cannot do better reader, can we? than permit
her to be a sea-captain, if she wishes it—especially as
our most vehement objections would be unavailing to stop
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>While superintending the lading of her vessel, she, with
her brothers, boarded at a comparatively quiet house near
the wharf. While at this house, one day she picked up
from a parlor table a newspaper, and listlessly ran her eyes
down the uninteresting sahara of its advertising columns,
when her glance was arrested by the following “want:”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c020'>WANTED—TO PURCHASE OR LEASE FOR A TERM OF YEARS a moderate
sized country seat in a secluded situation. A sea-coast location preferred.
Address box 333, P. O., stating terms, etc.</p>

<p class='c006'>Does the reader happen to know how many fates daily,
hourly, turn upon the mere chance-seeing and answering of
newspaper advertisements?</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, no sooner had Barbara Brande read this “want”
than a possibility presented itself to her active mind, such as
had never occurred to her previously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A country house in a secluded situation; a sea-coast
location preferred.” Why our old house on the Headland
is the very place this advertiser wants—if it were only in
repair! But perhaps this person, if he has capital to spare,
would take it and put it in repair; for I shouldn’t wonder,
being the precise sort of house he wants, that he would be
able to find just such another. Just precisely such houses
to let, are not as plenty as muscle-shells. And if he will
take it and repair it, and deduct the price of the repairs
from the rent, why should I not lease it to him, rather than
let the old place lie idle until it falls to pieces? As for me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>and my boys—our home henceforth will be the ship! Why,
therefore, should I not get the rents for this old house, so
as to lay an anchor to windward for the boys? It is true
that there is poor old Nep and his wife, who need a home.
But it will be easy to make a proviso in the lease securing
them the use of the cabin they now occupy, and the little
garden spot of ground around it, ruminated Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll do it if I can.” She shortly determined; and sitting
down, penned a note, folded, and directed it to box 333
P. O. Then calling her brother Willful, she dispatched
him with it to its destination.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning she received an answer, written in a
bold, business-like hand, requesting her to present herself
at private parlor, number 3, house number 10 Blank-street,
and signed <em>S. Copsewood</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This looks as if Mr. Copsewood wanted to take the
house,” said Barbara, who lost no time in obeying the
summons.</p>

<p class='c013'>When she reached number 10, which she found to be an
elegant private boarding house, she inquired for room
number 3, and was at once shown up into a superbly furnished
private parlor, at the door of which she was received
by a rosy-cheeked waiting maid, who civilly inquired her
name and business, and having ascertained that she was the
person whom they were expecting, ushered her immediately
into the presence of the loveliest lady Barbara thought she
had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c013'>This beautiful, dark woman was clothed in deep mourning,
which, however, could not disguise the exquisite proportions
of her graceful form. Her complexion of the purest, palest
olive, was contrasted with jet-black, slender-arched eyebrows,
long drooping, black eyelashes, that effectually vailed the
large languishing dark eyes, and a rich redundance of silken
black ringlets that overshadowed the whole face, and lent
even a deeper tone to the deep melancholy of its expression.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>Barbara Brande was spell-bound, fascinated, not more
by the perfect beauty, than by the profound sorrow impressed
upon this most lovely countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is a most beautiful <em>shadow</em>,” thought Barbara; “but
where in the world have I seen a ray of <em>sunshine</em> answering,
feature by feature, to this exquisite shadow? Where
have I seen it? My acquaintance is not so extensive but
that I might soon recollect. Let me see! My conscience,
yes, I recollect! It is my Star of the Sea! my Island Princess!
My golden-haired Etoile! She it is who is the
<em>morning</em> to this dark lady’s <em>midnight</em>, the <em>sunshine</em> to her
<em>shadow</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While these thoughts passed rapidly through the mind
of Barbara Brande, the maid-servant presented her to the
lady, saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, Madam, is the young woman who has come about
leasing the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady lifted her languid lashes, and said, interrogatively—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam,” said Barbara, thinking that she had
never heard such liquid music break from human lips before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray be seated, Miss Brande. Susan, draw that arm-chair
forward.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan obeyed, and Barbara accepted the offered seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I received a note this morning from Mr. S. Copsewood,
appointing me to call here at this hour to open possible negotiations
respecting a house I have to lease. I happen to
have a drawing of the house executed by my brother Willful,
if Mr. Copsewood would like to see it,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady looked at the speaker with serious attention and
some perplexity, while Susan smiled merrily, displaying all
her white teeth.</p>

<p class='c013'>At last the lady said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are under an error, Miss Brande. The note received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>by you was written by my attendant, Susan Copsewood.
And I am the person who desires to lease a house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You, Madam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Myself—Mrs. Estel,” said the lady, placing the accent
on the first syllable of her name. “You may show me the
drawing, if you please, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara produced the drawing, and put it in the hands
of Mrs. Estel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you please to describe the place to me, while I
look at the sketch, Miss Brande?” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara complied, describing the situation of the house
and the scenery of the Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the picture and your description, I think the
place will suit me. You say, however, that the house is
much out of repair?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very much, indeed Madam; it would take five weeks
in time and labor, and five hundred dollars in money, to
make it comfortable,” replied Barbary, in whose rustic estimation
this sum seemed a very large amount. “But I am
willing, Madam, to give up the rent as long as necessary for
the repairs of the house. And I think, also, that the house
could be made ready for you sooner than you could find
another to suit you so well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think that is very likely. You have full power to
transfer the property?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am twenty-two years old, Madam, and I am the sole
executor of my father’s will, and the sole guardian of my
brothers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady, on hearing this, now, for the first time raised
her eyes, and looked full in the face of the strange girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>A tall, magnificently developed form, with no superfluous
flesh to impede activity; a strong, handsome face, with
flashing black eyes and bands of jet-black hair, and an expression
of pain, suffered and conquered, lingering around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>it,—a dress and cape of grey serge, a bonnet of coarse
straw, was the <em>tout ensemble</em> that met the lady’s gaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How is this Headland to be reached?” was the next
question asked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By means of the packet-vessels trading along the coast
of the Bay, Madam,” answered Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well. I will take a few days to reflect upon your
proposition, Miss Brande, and let you know the result.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Madam. It is proper to inform you, however,
that in a week hence I sail for the West Indies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady here again lifts her lashes with a look of inquiry,
to which Barbara replied—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have command of the ‘Stormy Petrel,’ Madam, and
shall set sail for Habana in six days.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady looked in gentle amazement upon the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me,” she said—“but could I possibly have
understood you to say that <em>you</em> had command of a vessel?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam, you understand aright.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady was too high bred to suffer any exclamation of
surprise or wonder to escape her; but she looked at Barbara
with such deep interest that the girl hastened to say—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are doubtless surprised, Madam; but you would
be less so, were you acquainted with the circumstances. I
am a strong girl; I was brought up to the sea, and taught
navigation and seamanship by my father, with whom I made
many voyages. When he was lost in his own ship, the
hapless Mercury, Madam, I was under the necessity of
looking about for a support for my young brothers. None
offered so readily as my father’s calling—that of a merchantman.
I understood no business so well as that. My
negroes were all sailors. My little brothers were old enough
to serve apprenticeship to the same business. Therefore I
am what I am, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Estel had been regarding her with the deepest
interest; when she ceased speaking the lady said—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>“Miss Brande, I think I may safely promise to give you,
to-morrow, your answer respecting the lease of the house.
I think also, that there is no doubt but that I shall take it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you have no further commands for me, Madam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you—no.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande arose, bowed, and withdrew toward the
door, followed by the rosy maid. With her hand upon the
knob, however, she paused—looked back and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon me, Madam, but there is a condition I should
mention before this matter goes any further.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Proceed, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It may be a mere trifle to yourself, my lady; but a very
important matter to me and <em>them</em>. In a word, I have
two tried and faithful old family servants, born on the estate,
brought up there, and now in their old age, living in
a small cabin with a garden which they cultivate; and I
should wish——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I understand you, Miss Brande,” gently interrupted
Mrs. Estel—“In the event of my taking the lease, the old
people shall not be disturbed. Is there any thing else,
Miss Brande?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you—no, Madam. The terms suit you, I
think?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The terms suit me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then there is nothing else. Good-day, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-day, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara now left the room attended by the maid.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Susan returned she closed the door, and approaching
her mistress, said, earnestly and respectfully—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will your ladyship go down to that bleak, lonely
place?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, Susan! Yes, Susan! I never could like the
town even in happiness; and now, now it suffocates me!
we with oppressed bosoms, need more room to breathe. I
long for the boundless woods, and the measureless sea!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>that is the reason why I prefer a wild, uncultivated coast.”
Susan approached her mistress, and sitting down on the
carpet by her side, half kneeling, half reclining, gazed upon
her face with an expression of mute, appealing affection.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Estel laid her hand benignantly upon the head of
the faithful girl, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Besides, Susan, I am imprisoned here; you know I have
not left this room, or seen a soul but yourself, since we came
here. I dare not go out, lest in a seaport town like this I
should be recognized.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Does your ladyship suspect then——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>That he is here.</em>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My heart! my heart! whom do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No! no, Susan! Do not tell me that! He has not
followed me here!” said the lady, whose pale, olive cheek
seemed turned to marble.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, speak! say you were mistaken—you might have
been mistaken!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, are you so distressed that his lordship should
prove the strength of his——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Girl! girl! be careful of your words.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, Madam,—the strength of his <em>esteem</em> and <em>respect</em>
for you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To what end should he prove it? Does it need proof?
Oh! why should he follow me here, only to renew a struggle
so bitter, so terrible, so agonizing!” thought the lady
to herself, as she sat twisting and wringing her white
fingers.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, take comfort. Consider that his lordship,
indeed, has the law on his side. Pardon me, sweet mistress,
for reminding you, that for all that has come and
gone you are his wife, and he has at least a right to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>hearing, that you have never given him; a right, in a word,
to plead his cause with you, and——”</p>

<p class='c013'>The hand of the lady sank softly but firmly upon the
head of the recumbent girl, and with her face, that was pale
before, now dark with the swelling up of a suffocating emotion,
she whispered huskily—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, forbear—you know not what you say—he must
be free and honored—he has a brilliant career before him—he
must cut me off—I fly that he may do so—I would <em>die</em>
to rid him of me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan looked up appalled at her lady’s face, in its dark
and terrible agony.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan! never, while you live, renew this counsel. But,
tell me now, are you <em>sure</em> you saw him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, perfectly sure, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In St. John’s church, yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He did not see you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Madam; I sat far back, in a dark corner. I wore
a vail also; and you know that when a thick vail is down
before our faces, close to our eyes, we can see through it
even at a distance, while those far off cannot recognize our
features. If it had not been for my dark corner and my
vail, I think his lordship might have discovered me, for he
was looking about a great deal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was he looking well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! my lady, pardon me, how could he be looking
well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady groaned, and covered her face with her hands.
The attendant continued—</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my lady, he was not looking well! He was very
thin and pale, worn and haggard, with a restlessness and
anxiety on his countenance and in his manners, that it half
broke my heart to behold. Oh, dearest lady, how can you
bear to——”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>“<span class='sc'>Susan!</span>” The word escaped like a sharp cry.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive me, lady, my feelings betray me into indiscretion,
sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am fearful, indeed, my girl, that you are not safe,”
said Mrs. Estel, gravely.</p>

<p class='c013'>After this there was a pause for some moments, and then
Mrs. Estel said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was that the only occasion upon which you saw him
here, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam; but I knew before that he was here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You knew it before, Susan, and never warned me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You would not permit me to tell you of the shipwreck,
lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no! I cannot bear to hear of the shipwreck.
There are wrecks of the heart and soul, God knows, that
none upon the ocean equals! And—but we were speaking of
<em>him</em>; and I do not see what the shipwreck you talk of has
to do with him, since, thank Heaven, he was not wrecked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has everything to do with him, dear lady! You
have confined yourself to this room ever since you arrived
in the city, never once going out—never seeing any one
here—never looking at a newspaper—never hearing any
news, and not even permitting me to speak to you of a subject
that is the universal talk of the city, yet of which you
know nothing. And yet, dear lady, it has something to do
with Lord Montressor, since his heroism upon that occasion
is the subject of universal applause.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Applause! truly, applause would seem the natural
attendant of Lord Montressor’s movements; but I wait to
hear what special act of his lordship called forth the applause
upon this occasion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To explain it, my lady, I should be obliged to speak in
detail of that fatal shipwreck, of which you have refused to
hear.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Proceed Susan, proceed and have done with it, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>girl; for I perceive that neither you nor I will have any
peace until I have consented to listen to all the horrors you
long to relate to me. Only be brief, then, and spare yourself
and me as much as possible,” said the lady, and resting
her elbow on the arm of the chair, and leaning her forehead
upon the palm of her hand, she composed herself into a
listening mood.</p>

<p class='c006'>Susan commenced and related just so much of the particulars
of the shipwreck as had reached her through the
public press, and through the conversation of those persons
with whom she had been thrown in company. One important
fact, however, she reserved for a separate recital—that
fact was the discovery and burial of the drowned body
of Victoire L’Orient.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor listened, with her head bowed upon
her hand, with her long, black ringlets falling vail-like
around her beautiful pale face, and with her full, dark eyes
lowered mournfully to the ground. But that consuming
grief had long ago dried up the fountain of her tears, they
must have fallen thick and fast over the sad recital. As it
was, her lovely eyes were tearless, and her deep melodious
voice calm, as she commented on what she heard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was indeed a fearful tragedy; but life is full of tragedies
that the eyes of the world see not, or the mind of the
world ignores—heart-tragedies, soul-tragedies—storms in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>which not ships and cargoes, but hopes and aspirations
are engulfed forever.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Lord Montressor, dear lady! surely his heroism—”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was a portion of himself, and does not in the least
surprise me, my girl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will nothing give her pleasure? not even her lover’s
heroism?” inquired Susan of herself, as she watched the
colorless, motionless face of her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not confine yourself to this room with me, my girl.
Get your bonnet and take a walk—only be discreet, keep
to the back streets, and the shady side, and do not raise
your vail. Go, Susan,” said the lady, considerate of her
attendant’s welfare.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, dear madam, but I have no desire to do
so. Besides, I have not told you all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think you have, my child: pray do not recur to the
subject, my Susan,” said the lady, wearily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, mistress, dear, this event that I have to tell you,
so nearly, so vitally, concerns yourself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady mournfully, incredulously, shook her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me tell you, madam: indeed, I have it upon my
conscience to tell you. I should have told you before, but
I was afraid to divulge it suddenly, lest I should do you an
injury; and every time I approached the subject gradually,
you repelled me and repelled me. Oh, it was as if a drowning
lady had waived off, and waived off the life-boat that
was coming to save her. And besides there are some
names that you will never endure to hear uttered in your
presence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, memory is a rack; and I—seek forgetfulness—as
if that were possible, great Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mistress, may I speak?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Monsieur Victoire L’Orient——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Hold!</span>” cried Lady Montressor, starting and then sinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>back in the corner of her chair, collapsed, cowering,
shuddering, as if that name had been a musket-shot sent
through her bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Is no more</span>,” persisted Susan, following up the shrinking
form of her mistress, and speaking close to her ear—“is
no more, do you hear, lady? is dead, drowned, buried
in the sea.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor lifted a pale, wild, incredulous face to
the speaker.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dead, drowned, buried in the sea,” repeated the
girl, emphatically.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor changed neither attitude nor expression,
but remained gazing almost fiercely upon the speaker.</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a word, madam, he was lost on the Mercury.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, so he was on the ‘Duke of Anjou,’” said the
lady, in a strange, ironical tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know; but this time, lady, he was drowned.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So he was before. He does not mind it, Susan: it
does not affect him in the least,” said Estelle, incredulously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, drowning certainly disagreed with him this
time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think it will be found that he is well and hearty,
Susan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I see you don’t believe it. But there is a full
account of the whole affair in the Baltimore American.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, so there was of the other affair in the London
Times—a reliable paper, Susan: yet you know the result.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my lady, but it is true now, beyond all doubt, that
the wretched man is dead. People don’t get over such
<em>attacks</em> twice—the second time it is sure to be fatal—it was
so in his case. His body was picked up by the Queen
Charlotte. Lord Montressor and Mr. Levering, the man
whom Lord Montressor saved, swore to the identity, which
was also further proved, if further proof had been necessary,
by the papers found on his person, and by the marks on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>clothes. His identity was proved and recorded, and he received
Christian burial, in the presence of the whole ship’s
crew. Lord Montressor and Mr. Levering, among the
others, saw his body committed to the deep.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While Susan spoke thus earnestly—solemnly—the ironical,
insane incredulity of the listener was lost in conviction
and awe. The face of the beautiful Estelle underwent a
great and fearful change. She, so pale before, grew still
paler, grew livid, while a blue circle darkened around her
eyes; she seemed on the verge of swooning, but rallied her
powers, and clinging to the arm of her chair for support,
inquired in a husky, almost sepulchral voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Is this true?</em>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“True as Gospel, dear lady! your mortal foe is dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then may the Lord have mercy on his soul! for he
greatly needed mercy,” said Lady Montressor, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a pause of some half hour, during which Lady
Montressor covered her face, and remained in deep thought
and prayer, and then the lady spoke:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, you may take the walk I advised, and while you
are out go down to the Ocean House, and see Miss Brande,
and let her know that I have fully decided on taking the
lease of the Headland, and that if she will have the documents
drawn up to-day, I will immediately conclude the
business.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan looked disappointed and distressed, and did not
move to obey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you hear my order, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, madam, I heard: pardon me; but, dearest lady,
dearest mistress, will not what I have just told you affect
your resolution?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In what respect?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In respect of your retiring from the world to that lonely
sea-coast.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why should it?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Dearest lady, pardon me! pardon one who loves you
more than her own life, for speaking upon this subject; but
remember now that you are free forever from all possibility
of annoyance from that haunting man; remember now that
happiness is within your grasp.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, forbear!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mistress, hear me! have mercy on yourself, and, above
all, on <em>him</em>. Do not go to that lone, sea-coast house; stay
here and wait for him; he has followed you across the sea,
he will find you in a few days; see him, lady; listen to
him; and then do as you will. Not the most ascetic monk,
or nun, or the most puritanical pietist of any persuasion
could venture to criticise your course, it has been, through
all this trying time, so blameless. Nor could saint nor
angel censure you now for receiving him. See him, hear
him, lady! Oh, would to Heaven there were some wiser
one than I am here to talk to you—some great learned
divine in whom you would have confidence. I, alas! I am
unlearned in theology, and my simple wisdom of the heart
may be despised,” said Susan, almost weeping.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You know that is not so, my child. I would trust the
‘simple wisdom’ of your true heart as soon—aye, sooner
than the opinion of the Archbishop of York. Is not your
relation to me more nearly that of friend than of an attendant,
Susan? Are you not in my confidence? Do I
not often take counsel with you, child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear lady, but—if you would only this once take the
<em>benefit</em> of my counsel,” replied the girl with a latent dash of
humor that respect for her unhappy mistress kept subdued.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, my good and loving child,” began the lady in a
mournful voice, “I will tell you, then, why I may not see
Lord Montressor. True, the haunter of my days is dead—but
<em>not</em> dead is the dreadful memory that I had been his—‘victim’—as
good Mr. Oldfield mercifully termed it.
True, also, that the law and the church not only acquitted,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>but vindicated me—not only pronounced me not guilty but
positively <span class='fss'>INNOCENT</span>; but that does not free me from the
clinging degradation of having been tried upon a criminal
charge! My peace is ruined, my fame blighted, my hopes
blasted—I am a human wreck, a walking shadow, a living
death—unfit to match with the vital glory of Charles Montressor’s
future. He is a man of brilliant genius. He is
distinguished, and will be celebrated. Every successful
man has hosts of bitter, carping, envious foes—vigilant,
quick, cruel, in seizing, denouncing, and exposing any possible
flaw in his life, character, or circumstances. Shall
<em>such</em> have power to say of Lord Montressor—‘He married
the “victim” of a French conspirator’—‘His wife was once
a prisoner before Exeter Assizes.’ No, no! Oh, no!
Merciful Heaven, no!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, lady! sweet mistress! hear your poor Susan, yet
a little while longer. Suppose you let his lordship have a
voice in deciding this matter, which concerns his happiness
quite as much as it does yours. Suppose you let him say
to you what we know he says to himself—‘I prize this precious
hand of yours more highly than all that mankind
could possibly lavish upon me. I should consider the loss
of it a heavier calamity than the loss of the favor of the
whole world’—what then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan! Susan! sooner than join my dishonored life to
his most honored one, I would fly to the most savage extremities
of the earth—yes! but for the grace of God,
sooner than that, I would leave the earth itself!” she exclaimed
with passionate earnestness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady, lady, I will say no more,” said Susan, beginning
to weep—a sure resort with her when there was nothing
else to be done.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor dropped her brow upon her hand
again, and fell into deep thought for a few minutes, at the
end of which she lifted her head and said—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>“Susan, my child, you followed a generous but too hasty
impulse in leaving home, and friends, and country, to share
the fortunes of a blighted woman like myself. I was very
wrong to permit you to do it. I should have seen this at
the time, but that the very tumult and passion of my flight
swamped every other thought. But it is not yet too late
to repair the injury that has been done you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady! good Heaven! what do you mean?” exclaimed
Susan, clasping her hands in deprecation of what
she felt was coming next.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, I can send you back to England.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have offended you! Oh, I have offended you! Forgive
me, my lady! my dear, dearest lady!” cried Susan,
wringing her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, you have not, my girl! my poor girl. How could
you offend me, Susan? Never did I value you more
highly than at this moment, when I talk of sending you
from me, and it is for the very reason that I esteem you so
much, I wish to discharge you. I think of your future,
Susan. If you leave me and return to England, you will
probably lead a cheerful, happy life, and in good time
marry happily; while, if you accompany me to my sad retreat,
what is before you but a dreary, solitary life, and an
age of old-maidenhood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady, I haven’t seen such joy among the married as
ever to envy them, the dear knows! and, besides, I have
always heard it said that a woman’s life is in her affections,
and I believe it. Now your poor Susan’s affections centre
upon you. It would break her heart to leave you. In a
word, dear lady, if you were to order her to depart, she
would for the first time in her life, disobey you, and follow
you until you gave her house-room or—in charge of the
police!” said Susan, falling into that lurking humor, that
under happier circumstances would have developed into
wit. “Marry-come-up! I mean Miserabili! Am I not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>sort of protege of your ladyship? Didn’t you take me, a
poor little bare-footed girl, out of a hillside hovel, and
didn’t you dress me neatly and put me into your own Park
school? and didn’t you encourage me week by week, and
month by month, and year by year, to learn? And didn’t
you take me thence into your own service, and still stimulate
me to improve my mind, and didn’t you lend me books,
and even direct my reading? And didn’t you month by
month, and year by year, absorb more and more of my life
into your own, until now I have no life without you? And
do you now talk of casting me off?——Forgive me, dear
lady, I have spoken freely, I fear, also impertinently, but I
have spoken <em>truly</em>. I cannot leave you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor turned away her head to conceal the
emotion that disturbed her countenance, and after a little
while she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! well! we will talk of this another time, Susan!
Meanwhile, hurry down to the Ocean House, and bring
that young woman to me; the facts that you have imparted
make it necessary to be expeditious.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a deep sigh Susan arose, put on her straw bonnet
with the thick green vail, drew a black silk scarf closely
around her sloping shoulders, and went quietly out upon
her errand.</p>

<p class='c013'>In two hours she returned, accompanied by Barbara
Brande, young Willful, and a lawyer, with the deed of lease.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor sat in her closely curtained parlor, near
a corner table, with her elbow on its top, and her head
averted from what little light there was, and resting upon
her hand, her long black ringlets falling around, and
throwing into deeper shadow the features of her beautiful
face. And so she received the party.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande first approached, and saluting her respectfully,
said that she had brought the lawyer with the
lease and her elder brother as a witness.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>Lady Montressor slightly lifted her eyelids, acknowledged
the presence of these others with a bow, and addressing
Barbara, said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let your attorney read the documents, Miss Brande—he
need not come nearer, I can hear his voice from where
he stands. Susan, place a chair for the gentleman—Miss
Brande, sit near him, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara retreated, and instructed the lawyer to begin.</p>

<p class='c013'>The documents were read and approved.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Barbara brought the articles and laid them upon
the table before the lady for her signature.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan dipped a pen in ink and handed it to her mistress
who affixed her name to both documents, <em>Le Estel</em>. Then
the pen was passed to Barbara, who signed hers, and next
to Susan Copsewood, who attached her firm autograph as
first witness, and finally to young Willful Brande, who
wrote his name as second witness. The articles were then
delivered, Lady Montressor receiving one copy and Barbara
Brande the other. The payment for the first year was then
tendered in advance, but Barbara preferred that the funds
should be devoted to the repairs of the house, and that
matter being amicably arranged, the business was completed.
The lawyer arose to take his leave, and was permitted
to do so; but when Barbara and her brother would
have departed, Lady Montressor made a sign desiring
them to remain for a few moments.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara returned and took the chair that had been
placed for her accommodation by Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful seated himself modestly at some distance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You were a sufferer by the wreck of the unfortunate
Mercury?” said Lady Montressor, in a voice of deep commiseration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, she was my father’s vessel; when she went
down I lost—my father, my brother, and my betrothed,—all,
all except these two boys, for whom I live.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>“Brave girl, that you live for them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Madam, you know then, that sometimes, in this
world of ours, it requires more courage to live than to die.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor essayed to speak, but only bowed; and
after a short pause, slightly changed the subject, by saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, Miss Brande, is not the career you have chosen a
strange, trying life for a woman—especially a young and
handsome woman?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not when her name is Barbara Brande—not when she
has been brought up on the sea and loves it—not when
she is strong and courageous—not when fate, by striking
her one stunning blow, has made her insensible to personal
danger—not when a storm of grief has rendered her, by
the strength of despair, fit to cope with all other storms—not
when she has two brothers to establish in life, who, like
all of their race, herself included, perhaps, are fit for
nothing but the sea,” said Barbara, earnestly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pray, forgive my interference; it is the interest with
which you have inspired me, Miss Brande, that urges me to
speak; but would it not be better to place your brothers,
since they must learn navigation and seamanship, with
some merchant captain in whom you have confidence, and
then seek, for yourself, some more feminine occupation or
interest on shore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, <em>no</em>, I cannot leave my boys, nor let them leave
me—particularly for the sea. Besides, my life is not the
life of other women: calamities like mine can never be
forgotten.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not say so; you are young yet; at your age, <em>all</em>
misfortunes may be outlived and forgotten—<em>except guilt or
disgrace</em>,” added the lady, in a thrilling, passionate, solemn
voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Neither the one nor the other has ever approached our
poor household, honored Madam; and never shall, while
Barbara Brande holds authority over it.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>“You speak with great assurance, young woman. Know
that it is not <em>always</em> in human power to ward off those
heaviest of human ills.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I speak, dear Madam, with a faith in the Divine protection,
as far from presumption, on the one hand, as it is
from doubt, on the other. The Lord prospers faithful endeavor.
It is to ward off temptation from them, that I
choose to watch over my brothers. There is no human
guardian like an elder sister, excepting, only, a mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A mother,” repeated Lady Montressor, sadly and
thoughtfully, recurring, perhaps, to the fine London belle,
who had shuffled off her maternal cares and responsibilities
upon a worthless French nurse and an unprincipled French
governess; and whose dereliction from duty had been the
origin of all her daughter’s calamities.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I lost <em>mine</em> at a very early age, yet, ever since, have I
been the mother of my young brothers; and if ever I grow
impatient of their boyish ways, I have only to remember
they are my dear mother’s orphan children, to bear with
them cheerfully. The calling that I have chosen, for their
sakes as well as my own, is not less befitting a woman than
that of the stage, the counter, the bar, or any of the hundred
ways by which poor women earn their bread, or support
their families. That it requires more courage and
firmness, surely does not render it more unfit for woman:
no woman will say that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no; it surely does not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I would rather,” said Barbara, “work a ship through
the fiercest tempest that ever a ship <em>survived</em>, than stand
before the footlights of a stage, face a mixed audience, and
act out a part in a play, during a whole evening—as I find
even cultivated women sometimes do in this city of yours.
Why, I hear the old sea-captains, down at the Ocean House,
criticising their personal points. My chosen life may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>unfeminine, but it will not expose me to indignities,” said
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have no more to say. We will rest the argument,”
said Lady Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara arose to take leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stay, Miss Brande, if you please. I did not call you
back for a fruitless talk. I understood you to say that
your vessel would be your future home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will it be your <em>only</em> one? Forgive the question, and
answer it frankly as it is asked.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, Miss Brande, permit me—I know how deep the
attachment one feels to her native home; I know how
strong yours must be to the Headland. Myself and maid
will take up but little room in that large house; therefore,
when you return from your voyage, come there as heretofore;
your two old servants will still be there to serve you;
come with your brothers, and make it your home as before.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, you are very good. Your most generous offer
has taken me by surprise; and well as I should like to accept
it, I am not sure that it would be right for us to profit
by your extraordinary kindness,” said Barbara, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do beseech you, my dear girl, not to hesitate, not to
entertain the least scruple upon this subject. I assure you
that your return to the Headland will be a personal satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Again I thank you from the depths of my heart, lady;
but I cannot gain my own consent at once to take advantage
of your kind offer. It would seem too selfish and
grasping on my part.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take time, then, my dear girl; but remember this the
while, that at <em>all</em> times the sight of your sail near the
Headland, or your face within its doors, can bring nothing
but pleasure to its lessee.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“I thank you earnestly, dear lady; and I promise you
that whenever I return from a voyage, whether I spend
much time with you or not, my sail shall be seen off the
Headland, and my face within your doors,” said Barbara,
gratefully, and once more she had made a move to go.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stay yet a moment. I wish to depart immediately for
that house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before it is repaired, Madam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—before it is repaired. If it were barely habitable
for you and your brothers, it is also habitable for me; and
I can superintend the repairs on the spot. I suppose
workmen can be found in the neighborhood?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is <em>no</em> neighborhood, dear lady; but workmen
can be had from the village of Eastville.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well—that will answer my purpose. Now tell
me, Miss Brande, do you know of any vessel about to sail
that could take us there?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Sea Mew will sail to-morrow, with the first tide,
for Havana. They have accommodations for passengers,
but no passengers, I think. She is a good ship. If you
were ready to sail in her, Captain Brewster could put you
on shore at the Headland.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will go, if I can get a berth. Miss Brande, could you
do me the great favor of letting your brother ascertain
whether I can get one?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have not the least doubt that you can secure a berth;
but I will assure myself as to the fact from Captain Brewster
himself, who boards at the Ocean House; and I will
send Willful to let you know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you very much.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is one thing I should tell you—two things, indeed:
first, it is necessary that you should take a supply of
provisions down with you, as there is no store nearer to
the Headland than Eastville—secondly, that if you go at
all, you should go on board <em>to-night</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>“I thank you for your careful instructions, Miss Brande,
and shall endeavor to follow them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will now take leave of you, lady, as no time should
be lost in seeing Captain Brewster and securing a berth.
Good-bye, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye, for the present. If I go, I shall see you
again this evening; if I do not go, I shall see you frequently
during our stay.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if it should so happen that you should not obtain
a passage in the Sea Mew, Madam, the Petrel will sail in a
week, and I should be very glad to have you, and could
make you passably comfortable in my cabin.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Miss Brande; and indeed, but for the
great haste I am in, I should much prefer to go with you.
By the way, shall you stop at the Headland on your way
down the Bay?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In any case, <em>yes</em>, Madam, I shall be obliged to do so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then if I am there in advance of you, I shall be happy
to receive you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Madam—now, indeed, I must hasten
away. Good-day, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-day, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And declining Susan’s attendance, Barbara and her
brother retired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Susan, we must have all things in readiness, in
case, as I expect, we shall be able to obtain a passage on
the Sea Mew. Pack up my trunks at once, girl, and afterward
we can attend to those out-door matters.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan obeyed, and the afternoon was so well spent in
preparation, that when at sunset Willful Brande presented
himself with the information that the lady and her attendant
could have a berth in the Sea Mew, coupled with a request
that they would come on board that night, because
the vessel was to sail with the first tide in the morning, he
found them in readiness to depart.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Willful Brande, by his sister’s directions, offered his services
to assist, called a carriage, helped the travelers into
it, and after seeing them off, remained behind to load and
bring the dray with their baggage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara met her new friend on the wharf, and accompanied
her on board the Sea Mew.</p>

<p class='c013'>They found the skipper, a bluff, hearty, gallant old
sailor, waiting on the deck. He received his lady passenger
with studied politeness, and handed her down into a
comfortable cabin. And Barbara having seen the lady and
her attendant fairly installed, took leave of them with the
promise to stop at the Headland on her way down the Bay.
In another hour, Willful Brande arrived with the dray containing
the luggage, which was conveyed on board and
stowed away.</p>

<p class='c013'>And the next morning, at sunrise, the Sea Mew, having
on board Lady Montressor and her maid, sailed for
Havana.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wind was fresh and fair, the weather fine, the water
scenery grand, the whole circumstances animating, as holding
out the prospect of a quick and pleasant voyage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady and her attendant were accommodated with a
state-room in the captain’s cabin; that state-room had,
through the care of Barbara, been neatly arranged—the
berths covered with white counterpanes, and the window
hung with a white muslin curtain. The cabin, through the
courtesy of Captain Brewster, was given up almost exclusively
to the use of his passengers.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the sad Estelle passed the most of her time, both by
day and by night, in sitting by the window of her state-room,
looking out upon the heaving sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was on the ninth day of their passage down the Bay,
and just at sunset, that Captain Brewster came into the
cabin and informed the lady that they were approaching
Brande’s Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Estelle put on her bonnet and mantle, and followed by
Susan, went up on deck, and looked out for her future
home.</p>

<p class='c013'>And there, a mile to the right, before them loomed the
dark and dreary Headland, crowned with its ancient trees
and half-ruined house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their baggage was already in the boat that was waiting
to take them to the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain assisted the lady and her maid to descend,
and followed them into it, the oarsmen plied their oars,
and in twenty minutes they reached the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>The captain handed his passengers to the beach, ordered
the baggage taken out, and finally came up to the lady, expressed
his regret at her departure, bade her adieu, and
re-entered his boat which was rowed rapidly back to the
ship.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, Estelle, and her maid, were left standing alone in
the twilight on the beach.</p>

<p class='c006'>The same evening Lord Montressor sat alone in his private
apartment in the City Hotel. He looked pale and
worn. A month had passed since his arrival in Baltimore,
and notwithstanding his utmost endeavors, he had discovered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>no clue to his lost bride. He had come to the conclusion
that she had left the city, and this evening he had
formed the resolution, to leave the next morning for New
York.</p>

<p class='c013'>While thus he sat in moody silence, neglecting the evening
paper that lay upon the table beside him, the door
opened, and Gridley, his lordship’s valet, presented himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Gridley was a grave, respectable-looking, middle-aged
man, rather bald-headed and stout, clothed in black, and
having quite the air of a high-church clergyman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Gridley?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my lord! I have most important information
for your lordship,” said his lordship’s gentleman, pompously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak! what is it? Any thing in regard to your
lady?” exclaimed Lord Montressor, rising anxiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lord! If ever I saw Lady Montressor in my
life, I saw her ladyship come out of a house and enter a
carriage to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At what hour? Where? Speak, man, in the name
of Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“From number ten —— street.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are sure?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As the carriage drove off and the people who had
opened the house door for her ladyship, went in and shut
it, I ran up the steps and took the number.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I ran down again as fast as I could and went after the
carriage at the height of my speed. But though I walked
so fast, the carriage which was driven very rapidly, distanced
me, and rolled out of my sight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In what direction?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Toward the wharves, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At what hour was this?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>“About half-past eight, your lordship.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are <em>sure</em> the house from which she went was——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Number ten —— street, my lord, assuredly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go call a cab.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The valet bowed and at once withdrew to obey.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor exchanged his dressing-gown for a
close-bodied coat, took his hat and gloves, and in three
minutes—by the time that Mr. Gridley put his head into
the door to announce the cab,—he was ready to enter it.</p>

<p class='c013'>He took out his watch.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is now half-past ten;—a late hour to make a call—but
under present circumstances, I cannot afford to be fastidious.
I shall ascertain if she lives in that house, and if
not, <em>where</em> she lives,” thought his lordship, as he took his
seat in the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where shall I go, sir?” asked the cabman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Number ten —— street,” said Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>A drive of half an hour brought them to the house.
Lord Montressor alighted and looked at his watch; it was
now eleven o’clock. He looked at the house; every
window was darkened, every room silent, every inmate apparently
asleep. He was very much disappointed. He
had hoped to have reached the house some fifteen minutes
earlier, and that some fortunate chance, such as an evening-party,
an absent inmate, a late guest, or any among the
thousand and one daily events, that happen to keep a family
up at night, might have occurred this evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was, as I said, very much disappointed.</p>

<p class='c013'>He could almost have found it in his heart to call up the
household to put to them the questions upon which he felt
as if his fate depended. But this he knew, however desirable,
was totally inadmissible. Ah! had he known the vital
importance of these passing previous hours, he would have
roused the family!</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was, he said to himself—that he was weakly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>culpably impatient—that a few hours could make no difference—that
the morning was altogether the more proper
time for making his meditated call and inquiry; and so
determining, he re-entered the cab, and gave the order—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Back to the hotel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At ten o’clock the next morning, Lord Montressor
entered a hack, and drove to the house in —— street.
Without waiting for the hackman’s ring to be answered, he
alighted and went up the steps, and reached the portico
just as a man-servant opened the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is Lady Montressor in?” was the diplomatic question
of his Lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor does not live here, sir,” answered the
negro.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you tell me where she <em>does</em> live?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Send”——(Lord Montressor glanced up at the name
on the door-plate,)—“Mrs. Brownloe here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; walk in, and take a seat, sir; what name shall
I take up, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say a gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The man disappeared, leaving Lord Montressor seated
in the drawing-room. And presently, the mistress of the
house entered. She was a tall, stout, middle-aged woman,
soberly attired in grey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Brownloe, I infer?” said Lord Montressor, rising,
and setting a chair for the lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, Madam,” said his lordship, announcing
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah!—resume your seat, my lord. You sent for me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam. I called, if you please, to make inquiry
of a lady who left your house in a carriage, last evening, at
half-past eight o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>“Oh! you mean Mrs. Estel?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle! Estelle!” exclaimed Lord Montressor to himself—then
aloud—“Yes, Madam; I speak of Mrs. Estel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! she left us, as you said, yesterday evening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should be very grateful to be informed whither she
went, Madam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I don’t know! I haven’t the least idea in the
world. I think she left the city, however.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps some member of your family may be better informed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! I know they are not; because I had some curiosity
to know where the lady went, and I made inquiries;
no one could satisfy me—all they knew was the direction
that the maid gave the hackman, and that the boy who had
charge of the luggage afterward gave the drayman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that was——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Light street wharf, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that is all the intelligence you can give me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All, sir; I am sorry it is so meagre; you are interested
in the lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam. I thank you very sincerely for the information
you have given me. Good-morning, Madam,”
said his lordship, not feeling disposed to be questioned in
his turn, and rising to take leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Light street wharf,” was the next order given to the
hackman, as he re-entered the carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>And to Light street wharf he was driven.</p>

<p class='c013'>On arriving at the spot, he alighted, and walked about
among watermen, porters, sailors, laborers, and all the miscellaneous
crowd of the docks, and, addressing an old
skipper, he inquired what vessel left that wharf since eight
the preceding evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The only ship as has left the port at all, capting, is the
Sea Mew, Captain Brewster, as sailed from this wharf at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>sunrise this morning, bound for Havanna,” replied the accurate
old sailor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had she passengers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“More’n I can tell you, capting.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaving Mr. Gridley to mingle among the sailors at the
wharf, and find out whether the Sea Mew had carried passengers,
and whether those passengers were females, Lord
Montressor once more re-entered his carriage and drove
back to the hotel to await the result.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was late in the afternoon when Gridley presented himself
before his master.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Gridley?” said his lordship, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my lord, I have ascertained that two females, answering
to the description of Lady Montressor and her
attendant, at nine o’clock last evening embarked on board
the Sea Mew, bound for the West Indies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! then I have her again; but it is certain that the
lady was bound for the West Indies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lord, certainly,” replied the valet, falling into
a very natural mistake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was the information you obtained to be relied upon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Without doubt, my lord, since it was from the hackman
that took her ladyship from —— street to the ship, and from
the drayman who conveyed her ladyship’s baggage to the
wharf, and from the porters who assisted in its transportation
to the vessel—all of whom I hunted down and questioned,
my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have done your duty well, and I thank you,
Gridley. Did you, by the way, happen to hear of any
other vessel soon to sail for the West Indies?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my lord.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hand me the evening paper.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Gridley gave his master the “News.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor turned to the Marine Intelligence, and
ran his eye down the list, muttering:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>“For Liverpool, um—For Havre, um—um—For New
Orleans, um—um—um—For Havanna—here we have it!
For Havanna, the Petrel, Brande master, to sail on the
first of October. This is the twenty-fifth of September.
Gridley, we sail for Havanna in a week—be ready.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lord.”</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Early the next morning, Lord Montressor went down to
the wharf to inquire for the Petrel.</p>

<p class='c013'>A trim, tight-looking little clipper, standing a cable’s
length down the river, was pointed out to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>He called a boat, got into it, and directed to be rowed
to the Petrel.</p>

<p class='c013'>On arriving alongside the vessel, Lord Montressor found
himself in the midst of a busy scene. Many other boats,
heavily laden, were around the clipper, the crew of which,
seeming to consist of four negroes, were engaged in taking
in freight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor directed his boat to be pulled up to the
starboard gangway, and forthwith went on board, where,
besides the four black sailors, who were engaged in hauling
up heavy bales from the boats on the larboard, he found
two manly boys of about ten and twelve standing on the deck.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>“Can you direct me to the Captain?” asked Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>The darkies suspended their labors for an instant to look
at each other and grin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Captain, my good fellows—the Captain—where is
he?” again asked Lord Montressor, thinking they had not
understood the first question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The gentleman asks for the Captin! My eyes, Sam!
I reckon he’s bound for Point No-Point,” said one of the
men; and all, negro-like, slackened their ropes and left off
work, to gaze, grin, or gossip, as opportunity might offer.</p>

<p class='c013'>But before Lord Montressor had time to reiterate his
question, he was startled by a clear, ringing, sonorous voice,
shouting:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ahoy there! What are you about men! look alive!
look alive! bear a hand! bear a hand! so——!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The men laid themselves with a good-will to their ropes,
and the heavy bales and boxes soon swung between the
boats below and the bulwarks above.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor turned to ascertain whence the cheery
voice came; and he saw, standing upon the deck, with a
small speaking-trumpet in her white hand, a tall, handsome
young woman, with a finely developed form, broadly-expanded
chest, frank, resolute countenance, shining black
hair, and flashing black eyes. Her dress and hood of
coarse grey serge could not disguise her singular beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So——That’s it! Haul hearty! cheerly boys!—cheerly!—so——!”
called the same animating voice, as
the men hoisted in the freight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she lowered the little speaking-trumpet, and advanced
to receive Lord Montressor, who was going toward
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some sister, or daughter, or perhaps wife of the skipper,
doing duty in his absence. Some shore-mate acting as shipmate—a
very piquante position, upon my word!” thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>Lord Montressor, as he paused before the young Amazon,
and lifted his hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you do, sir? Have you any business with me?”
asked Barbara. The tone was frank, short, decided, almost
abrupt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have business with the skipper, if you will be so kind
as to direct me where to find him, young lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! you wish to see Brande, Master?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here he is, then,” said Barbara, laying her hand proudly
and fondly on the head of the elder boy, who stood at her side.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor looked surprised and perplexed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me, Madam, did I understand you to say——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That this lad is Brande—Master? Yes, sir! The vessel
belongs to him and his brother, and sails under his name.
But until he attains his majority and acquires a competent
knowledge of navigation and seamanship, I, his sister, am
Acting Master. I am the responsible person here, sir, if
you have business with the ship. (Ahoy, there! Bob! man
the long-boat and go on shore to bring off those bales.)
Now I am ready to listen to you, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me, Madam! but expecting to find Captain
Brande to treat with, I came on board hoping to be able to
secure a passage to the West Indies for myself and men.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are you, sir?” The question was frank, direct,
and abrupt like all her talk.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon me, I should have anticipated your question; I
am the Viscount Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how many men have you, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two—a valet and a groom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir, I know of no reason why you should not find
a berth here. We are prepared to accommodate a limited
number of passengers. (Look alive there, boys!) We sail
on the first of October, sir, wind and tide favoring, and
shall be glad of your company.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Here was a dilemma!</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor was, of course, far too high bred to
<em>express</em> his surprise, perplexity and doubt, and he was also
too self-possessed to <em>betray</em> those emotions to any creature
less quick-sighted and penetrating than the Amazon before
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was, Barbara saw and understood the utmost extent
of his amazement, hesitation, and curiosity—perhaps it
piqued her, for she suddenly exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir! since you have come on business, bring it to
a conclusion. Question me, sir. Question me, sir. I had
far rather be questioned by a gentleman, than see him
stand silent before me, suffering the pangs of suppressed
curiosity!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The blood rushed to Lord Montressor’s brow, and half in
displeasure, half in amusement, he replied—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I regret very much that I have such a tell-tale countenance—but
I am sure you will pardon me for the involuntary
betrayal of the surprise I felt, at finding so young
and handsome a woman, in so novel a position.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara bowed—lowly, and perhaps ironically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You arraign me, sir! if not in words, yet in thought. I
am put upon my defense. Come, sir! read the indictment—let
me hear wherein I have broken the laws of God or
man.”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“What a termagant!” thought Lord Montressor; but
he said)—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nay, indeed, Miss Brande, I arraign you not—I simply
<em>wonder</em>—begging pardon, for even so much.”</p>

<p class='c013'>(“He thinks I am a vixen,” said Barbara to herself; then
aloud)—</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no need of wonder, sir. It is all very simple.
I am left guardian to two boy brothers, whom I am to support,
and to bring up to self-support. I chose the means
best fitted to the end.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“But might not some more—I beg pardon, I grow impertinent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so, since I have challenged examination, sir!—you
were about to inquire——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whether some more proper feminine occupation might
not have been found?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought so! there it is again! What, precisely, do
you call proper feminine occupation?—sewing? teaching?
acting? keeping boarders? selling goods?” Barbara drew
a long and deep inspiration, that seemed to relieve her
breast of the weight of these thoughts, and resumed—“No,
sir—these may all be sufficiently feminine, but they require
certain qualifications in which, happily or unhappily, I am
deficient; they also involve confinement, subordination, and
patronage—which my soul could not, for an instant, brook!
For I am born to freedom, independence, and domination!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet, methinks all these are not incompatible with the
life of a hostess, a teacher, or a shopkeeper.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara laughed scornfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Miss Brande, it does suggest itself to me that a
sufficiency of freedom, independence and domination might
be found in a house of your own, a school of your own, or a
shop of your own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And still more in a <span class='fss'>SHIP</span> of my own!” cried Barbara—her
black eyes flashing in triumph and exultation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor regarded the handsome Amazon, with
an expression half of admiration, half of wonder. She continued—</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir, I am unfitted by nature and education to
spend my life in pouring out coffee for old bachelors, pointing
out A, B, C’s to little children, or pulling down goods
for idle lady-shoppers. And on the other hand—I am prepared
both by constitution and culture for my present
vocation. Like all the men and women of my house, I love
the sea; from four years old to fourteen, I sailed with my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>father, who taught me navigation and seamanship, which I,
with my ardent attractions to the subject, learned much
more readily and thoroughly, than many a dull or unwilling
cadet of the Naval schools has done. So being prepared
for it, driven toward it, and attracted by it, I enter my sea life.
No, Lord Montressor, there is something in my
blood and in my circumstances, that could not brook the
quiet land life you have cut out for me! no more than the
majority of women could bear the life into which I rush
with enthusiasm. Be it so! every one to the bent of their
own taste and talent. Such I take to be God’s order.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have nothing more to say, Miss Brande, except this:
Taking it for granted that you are, as you say, well fitted
for your position; still, are you <em>safe</em>? In exigencies that
may arise, when life may depend upon discipline, will your
crew obey you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara smiled proudly and confidently. “Lord Montressor!
you are, doubtless, a better student in history than
myself! Have you noticed in your reading, that whenever
the reins of government have fallen into the hands of woman,
they have been less successful than men in enforcing
their authority and putting down revolt? Did England’s
magnificent Elizabeth ever quail before her ministers, or
her people, or fail to enforce her own royal will?—or
Russia’s terrific Catherine, blench in the bloodiest scenes
of her time? There are such Elizabeths and Catherines at
the present day, and in the humblest walks of life, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor bowed, and Barbara continued—</p>

<p class='c013'>“As for my crew, I have the means of compelling them
to obedience.”</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship looked incredulous.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There are but eight souls in all of this ship’s company—first,
there is myself, Acting Master, and my black maid—then
come my two brothers, who are devoted to their
sister; then my two negroes, who will obey me as only old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>family servants, who have watched over me on land and sea,
from childhood to womanhood, would do; and, lastly, there
are two enlisted men—one of whom is an old seaman, who
sailed often with my father, and is perfectly reliable; and
the other is a young fellow whose countenance is a letter
of recommendation, if he had no other—as he has. So
that you see, sir, I have not an insubordinate or dangerous
character on board.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see you have exercised judgment in the selection of
your hands.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With all this, sir, you may not feel sufficient confidence
in my competency for the post I have assumed, to trust
your valuable life with us for the voyage. Nevertheless,
sir, Messrs. Gobright &#38; Co., Merchants on Light street—men
who are not suspected of lunacy, have entrusted me
with a very valuable cargo.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor bowed absently; his thoughts had reverted
to one far away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Am I to understand that you decline a berth with us,
sir?” inquired Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>This brought his lordship to the point.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly not, Miss Brande. Upon all accounts, I
would not forego this opportunity—no, not for a seat in his
majesty’s cabinet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, then, into the cabin and let us arrange the terms—come
you, also, Willful! you must learn to transact business,”
said Barbara, beckoning Lord Montressor and her
brother to follow.</p>

<p class='c013'>They went below, and the terms—where one party was
willing and the other anxious—were soon concluded to their
mutual satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was near sunset when Lord Montressor left the vessel
for the shore, to return to his hotel.</p>

<p class='c013'>He employed the succeeding days of the week in writing
letters to England, and in preparations for his voyage.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>Was it strange that, in his conversations with Barbara,
he should never once have mentioned or even remotely
alluded to the object of his voyage? We think not; for
the subject of his lost Estelle was too sacred to be approached,
except under urgent necessity, or in the hope of
obtaining direct information. And what necessity did there
seem to be for taking Barbara into his confidence? what
information could he suppose her able to give? or what
connection could he possibly imagine to exist between his
delicate and reserved Estelle and this brave daughter of the
sea? In fact, he never once thought of such a possibility.
And yet, had he once broached the subject, how soon Barbara
could have told him that Mrs. Estelle had sailed, not
for the West India Isles as he supposed, but for a much
nearer point, namely, Brande’s Headland, a hundred miles
or so down the bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>So full is life of mere paper walls!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a fine frosty morning, the first of October, when
the Petrel was to sail. A fresh wind that had sprung up
during the night was blowing from the north-west. At
daybreak Lord Montressor entered a hack to drive down to
the wharf. His valet and groom followed, with the baggage
on a dray. A ride of an hour brought them to the
scene of embarkation. The wharves presented a busy, animating
appearance. The harbor was crowded with shipping,
whose tall masts, yards, and ropes were distinctly
traced upon the background of a clear blue sky. But the
Petrel stood off at anchor, some cables’ length down the
river. And to reach her, it was necessary to hire one of
the many boats that glided in and out among the vessels.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor signalled his groom from the top of his
dray, and dispatched him to engage one.</p>

<p class='c013'>The man soon effected this purpose; and a large, substantial
boat, roomy enough to accommodate Lord Montressor,
his attendants and his baggage, was rowed up close
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>alongside the wharf upon which they stood. The trunks
were first lowered into the boat, then Lord Montressor,
followed by his valet and his groom, entered and seated
himself in the stern. The four sailors laid themselves to
their oars, and the boat flew over the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few minutes they were alongside the Petrel which,
in her neatest trim, was preparing to get under way. They
pulled around to the starboard gangway, where Lord Montressor
went immediately up the ladder and stood upon the
deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>In truth, the vessel presented an animating spectacle.
Some of the men were busy with the ropes, others with the
windlass. The eldest boy was at the tiller.</p>

<p class='c013'>But most conspicuous upon the deck stood the handsome
Amazon, Barbara Brande, in her strong, grey serge dress,
but bareheaded, with the fresh wind making free with her
blackest of tresses, and flushing with a deeper crimson her
sun-burned cheeks. She stood there self-possessed and
giving orders in her own clear, ringing, decided tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Seeing Lord Montressor, she immediately came forward
to meet him, saying, in her high, cheerful voice:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Welcome, sir! you are just in time. We shall be under
way in half an hour. You know where to find your quarters,
sir. Will you go below, or——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will remain on deck, if you please, Miss Brande,” said
his lordship, who was not a little curious and interested to
see how this girl would proceed to get her vessel under sail—feeling
doubtful, also, of the sound discretion of embarking
his life on such a venture.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, sir! as you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Barbara left him and went forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ahoy, there, Willful! see to getting Lord Montressor’s
baggage up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lad left the tiller to obey. The hoisting of the trunks occupied
but a few minutes; the stowing them but a few more.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>The deck being then clear again, Barbara went forward
to give orders, which she did in short, firm, resonant tones,
that must have startled a stranger less prepared for them
than Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All hands up anchor! Each man to his post!—and
you, Willful, to the helm!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The orders were obeyed with alacrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Man the windlass.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The four sailors came forward and laid themselves to the
bars.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heave! heave hearty, my men! And you, Edwy, play
up, my boy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>This last order was given to the younger lad, who raised
the fife he held in his hand and began to play a lively inspiring
air, while the men with all their strength heaved at
the windlass. The anchor was soon apeak, and hauled up
to the side of the vessel, catted and fished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quick! now, my men!—haul in the larboard braces
forward!—haul home the starboard braces abaft!” shouted
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was done.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stand by to set the tops’il! Man the lee sheet! Ease
down the buntlines and lee clew-line! Haul home the lee
sheet! Now then, hoist away! Cheerly, boys—cheerly!
Brace all taut!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The tops’il thus set, the vessel moved slowly before the
wind, bearing down toward a schooner that was coming in,
on the lee side.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara shouted—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You, Willful! what are you about there? Port the
helm! Keep her clear of that schooner ahead! So—steady—nothing
off!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lad understanding the risk, exerted himself until all
danger of collision was past.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Set the jib!—there!—Hoist the mains’il!—Brace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>round—there—there!—Stand by to haul out the mizzen!—And
you, Willful, helm-a-lee!—so!—steady—stead-y!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sails now filled with the wind, the craft moved
swiftly onward. But Barbara thought that she could carry
more canvas. She gave the order—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stand by to hoist the to’-gallant-s’il!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The men worked heartily. And the vessel, now under
as much sail as she could safely carry, ran before the wind,
and passing between the North Point and the Bodkin,
stood gallantly out to sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara drew a long breath, and came aft to speak to
her passenger. Her cheeks were beautifully flushed, her
eyes were sparkling, and her black hair, in that short ripple
that indicates great vigor of constitution, was floating
freely in the breeze. She seemed in no wise “breathed”
by her late exertions. Lord Montressor, as he looked at
her, thought he had never in his life seen a finer woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have the prospect of a pleasant voyage, sir,” she
said. “With us, the prevailing winds are, at this season,
from the North West; we shall probably sail before a fair
wind the whole way. Neither, this month, is there much
chance of a thunder storm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor bowed. “That is an agreeable hearing,
Miss Brande; but do you not stop at any port on your
voyage out?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At no port, sir; but I shall cast anchor for a few hours
at the Headland—my old home, sir, where I shall have to
go ashore, to settle some final business with the young
widow lady who has leased it of me. And if you shall be
disposed to accompany me there, sir, I can show you one
of the oldest houses in Maryland—a house that was built
in the year 1635.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when shall we reach this Headland?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With this fair wind, in six or seven days, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now what fatality was it, that prevented Lord Montressor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>from finding out the name of “the young widow lady”
who had leased Barbara Brande’s house?—or from at once
accepting her invitation, when they should reach the Headland,
to go on shore and look at the house? That life is full
of blindly missed possibilities, is the only answer I can find.</p>

<p class='c013'>They continued talking much longer; Lord Montressor
growing every moment more pleased with his acquaintance;
for there was a frankness, a directness, an uprightness
and a <em>down</em>rightness about Barbara Brande, that commanded
respect.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me now, sir,” she said, at last, “I must go and
relieve my young helmsman; he is tired, I know,” and
going forward, she took the tiller from the hand of the boy
and sent him away.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had, as Barbara predicted, a very quick and pleasant
run down the Bay; and on the morning of the eighth
day, at sunrise, anchored off the Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor came on deck, where he found Barbara
giving her orders. On seeing him she came aft.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, sir! You are out early! We have
just cast anchor. We shall lie here all day. Look, sir!
there is my dear, old home.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor looked across the water to the dark
Headland that, crested with its old forest trees, loomed to
leeward. The sun, rising behind the shore, threw the
whole place into the deepest shadow—altogether it presented
a gloomy, weird, and forbidding aspect.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is very picturesque,” said Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!—and very interesting in some of its features.
They are getting ready the boat for me to go on shore. I
should be happy to have you over, if you would like to accompany
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Miss Brande—if you or your tenant will
give me the privilege of a day’s shooting in your woods, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>shall be pleased to go on shore,” said Lord Montressor,
bowing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sir! We have no game laws or preserves here!
Our game is as free as it is abundant—our woods as open
as they are extensive. I am very glad that you should be
able to amuse yourself for a day. There are also stanch
pointers at the Headland, and old Neptune who has them
in charge will be as good a guide as any gamekeeper in
England,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor expressed his thanks.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, my lord, let us to breakfast; and then to the
boats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor first went below to order his groom to
get out his fowling-piece, powder-flask, shot-pouch, game-bag,
etc., and then followed Barbara into the cabin, where
the early morning meal was spread.</p>

<p class='c013'>After breakfast, leaving Willful and two sailors in charge
of the vessel, Barbara, her younger brother, Lord Montressor,
and his groom entered the boat and were rowed
rapidly toward the Headland. On reaching the beach
Barbara said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you go up to the house, sir?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I thank you very much, Miss Brande; I think
not,” replied his lordship, feeling unwilling to intrude upon
the unknown Lady, who was Barbara’s tenant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then—come hither, Edwy! attend Lord Montressor to
Uncle Nep’s quarter. Tell the old man to take the dogs,
and show his lordship where to find the birds,” said
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Edwy came forward and bowed, expressing his readiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>And with a mutual “good-morning,” the parties separated—Barbara
Brande going up to the house, while Lord
Montressor and his companions sought the woods.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>We left Estelle and her attendant on the lonely beach
below the Headland, with the night coming on.</p>

<p class='c013'>They looked about themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>At their feet lay the baggage, with no one near to take
it away. Above their heads arose the steep cedar-grown
bank, with no visible path up its ascent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Westward rolled the infinite sea, now fast darkening
under the evening sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>Eastward stretched the impenetrable forest, falling into
deeper gloom under the lowering shadows of night.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the sombre and solitary scene they turned to look
into each other’s faces.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Blessed saints, my lady! what a savage coast! does
any living thing inhabit it, do you think?” asked Susan,
with a shudder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, certainly, you know it, my girl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beg your pardon, dear lady, but indeed, no, I don’t
know it. I’m afraid the captain has put us ashore at the
wrong place; and I, for my part, feel as if we were cast
upon some desert island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But did you not see the house from the ship?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lady; but now I think of it, that makes the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>matter more frightful; for it must have been a bewitched
house, and we must be on enchanted ground, else what’s
become of it? I don’t see so much as a chimney of it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because we are below the line of vision, being too
close under the bank. The house is up on the headland,
back among the trees.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then how shall I break a path for you, dear lady? for
you can never get through these briars!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is a path broken, and well worn, of course. And
there is an aged couple of servants somewhere near here,
who, Miss Brande informed me, had the keys, and would
show us up to the house, and open it for us. The path to
their cabin starts from this landing, she said. Let us look
for it, Susan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Holy saints, my lady, the sky is growing so dark that
I could not see a conflagration!” said the girl, peering
closely to the ground; “and the grass is so thickly strewn
with fallen leaves, that——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sarvint, Mist’ess!” uttered a gentle, growling sort of
voice from the bushes near her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah-h-h!!” yelled the maid. “Sweet Providence, what
is that? We shall be murdered by this savage,” and frantic
with terror, she ran toward her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle laid her hand soothingly upon the girl’s shoulder,
and turned to see what the cause of the alarm might be.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the gentle-hearted old negro, Neptune, who now
emerged from the bushes, and came into full view. And
if the terrible sea-god himself had risen from the waters,
sceptre in hand, he could not have stricken greater terror
to the heart of the simple English maiden! And, in truth,
the mistress also gazed upon the apparition in some doubt,
as well she might, for the good old man was rather an
awful looking object.</p>

<p class='c013'>His form was tall, gaunt, and bent beneath the weight
of an hundred winters. His face was black, hard, shining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>and seamed with wrinkles as a dried prune, and framed
around with snow-white hair and beard in spectral contrast
to its blackness. A suit of duck, seeming almost as old
and weatherworn as himself, and a tattered blanket, pinned
with a thorn around his neck, and hanging in ragged folds
about his figure; a black tarpaulin hat, with a red handkerchief
passed over the crown and round under his chin;
and shoes of undressed leather, completed his strange and
picturesque attire.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his hand he carried a rugged, unhewn club, upon
which he leaned in walking.</p>

<p class='c013'>On approaching the strangers, he pulled the hat and
handkerchief from his head, and holding them, came on,
bowing and bowing, as in deprecation of their displeasure
for the fright he had unconsciously given.</p>

<p class='c013'>The maid shrank away, but the mistress went forward to
meet him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sarvint, Mist’ess,” once more said the old man, bowing
very humbly, and then standing hat in hand before the
lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-evening. You are Miss Brande’s servant?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She has let me her house. She referred me to you for
the keys. We have just arrived to take possession. Will
you, therefore, be so good as to get the keys, and show us
the way thither?” said the lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, this event was so unexpected that it took some
time to make its way into the slow and unprepared brain
of the old negro. He found nothing to say or do, but
only stood bowing and bowing. Lady Montressor repeated
her directions.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the old man, “still far wide,” only answered by
another deep obeisance, and the pointless words:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mist’ess—’deed it are.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor glanced hopelessly around toward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Susan, who stood peeping over her mistress’s shoulder, and
whose fears had disappeared before the gentle, deprecating
manners of the black.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what an old jelly brain!” she exclaimed impatiently,
coming forward and confronting the old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, honey, jes’ so,” replied the latter, bowing to her,
and in no degree disturbed by the rudeness of her words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Chut! can’t you understand, you antique idiot, that
my mistress has rented the house from Miss Brande, and
that she wants to get into it?” asked Susan, angrily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Cisely so, honey. When’s Miss Barbara spected
home?” asked the old creature, mildly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan lost the last remnant of her patience.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look here, ancient simpleton, we are tired of standing
here! Where are the keys?” she peremptorily demanded.</p>

<p class='c013'>The curtness of her tone brought the old man at last to
a point.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There ain’t but one key—de front door key; I carries
it about with me. ’Cisely so, Mist’ess, here it are,” he
said, producing a huge, old-fashioned iron key, that might
have sufficed for a prison lock.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, now, go on before us, and open the door,” commanded
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mist’ess; zactly so, chile,” was the meek reply, as
the old man, advancing his stick, groped along and struck
into the narrow hidden path, leading up the ascent of the
headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, stop! will the baggage be safe here?” inquired
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Cisely so, honey. Dere’s nothin’ to ’sturb it,” said
Uncle Neptune.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, please take hold of my arm; the path is
very steep, and slippery with the fallen leaves,” said the
maid.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now quite dark.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>Lady Montressor availed herself of the proffered assistance,
and in a few minutes they reached the top of the headland,
and stood upon a level with the ancient trees and the
old house, half hidden among them, and dimly perceived
through the darkness. Uncle Neptune going before, went
up the steps and unlocked the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take care, my lady, for the love of mercy! there is not
a plank fast on these ricketty stairs,” said Susan, anxiously
guiding her delicate lady’s steps up into the dilapidated
portico.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Neptune was within side the door, hammering at
something that he held in his hand, and with which he presently
struck a light, by means of which they saw the whole
length of the old-fashioned hall; and beside the front door
a tiny cupboard, from which the old man had produced a
tinder-box and a candle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dis way, Mist’ess. ’Cisely so! Dis is the bes’ parlor,”
he said, opening the door on the right, and admitting them
into a large, scantily-furnished room.</p>

<p class='c013'>The single tallow-candle made the darkness here so terribly
“visible,” that the old man, after standing it upon the
solitary table, and dragging forward two rush-bottom chairs
for the strangers, hurried out to the little cupboard, and
brought three or four more candles, which he lighted, and
set in a row on the mantle-piece.</p>

<p class='c013'>With this extra illumination, Susan looked critically
around upon “the best parlor.” The vast dreary room had
one great merit—immaculate cleanliness. The bare walls
were white, the bare floor was pure. One oak table stood
between the two front windows, and upon it sat the model
of a frigate, under full sail—the work of Willful Brande;
at equal distances around the room were ranged a half-dozen
rush-bottom chairs; the wide fire-place was filled with fresh
cedar boughs; on the mantle-piece were several rare sea
shells, an empty ostrich egg, a whale’s tooth, a fragment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>the old “Constitution,” sprays of coral, lumps of amber, and
other articles collected by Captain Brande during his numerous
voyages. That was all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Though this was the tenth of October, the night was very
chilly, and the large room really cold.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would you like a fire, Mist’ess?” asked Uncle Neptune.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! certainly, yes! What are you thinking of?
Ugh! I believe we had as well gone to Lapland,” exclaimed
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man took the mass of evergreens from the chimney,
carried them out, and soon returned with an armfull
of brush, with which he proceeded to light a fire. As the
cheerful blaze crackled and ran up the chimney, diffusing
light and warmth throughout the room, Susan rubbed her
hands, congratulated her mistress, and set a chair near the
fire for her accommodation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now then, old father! you <em>are</em> a nice old man, on a
longer acquaintance—how shall we get our baggage to the
house?” inquired the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hem-m—Jes so, chile. Me and my ole ’oman and Sam
kin fetch it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Cisely so, honey—Island Sam, as is on a wisit to us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some acquaintance of yours, I suppose. Very well, my
good old father! go and attend to it, and you shall be well
paid for your trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Zactly so, honey,” replied the poor old fellow, bowing
himself out.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the door closed behind him, Susan took off her
bonnet and shawl, put them on a chair and approached her
mistress, who during these few minutes, had been sitting
before the fire, in a mood of deep abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, Madam, permit me to relieve you of these,” she
said, gently and respectfully, as she untied the ribbons and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>removed her lady’s bonnet, and unbuttoned and took off her
mantle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor suffered her to proceed, and then drew
a deep inspiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t sigh, dear lady!” said Susan, mistaking the cause
of her mistress’s pensiveness—“the old barn is, after all,
not so bad. Means will make it very comfortable, and even
now it is perfectly clean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sit down, and cease to trouble yourself, child. The
house does very well,” said Lady Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan obeyed, and was very still for about fifteen minutes,
at the end of which the footsteps of the men bearing the
baggage were heard approaching.</p>

<p class='c013'>She hurried out to meet them. The trunks were brought
in, and placed for the present in the hall, and the men went
back to bring the hampers.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the old woman who had accompanied them, came
into the parlor to offer her services to the lady. Going up
to her, she stood and courtesied, with the customary—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sarvint, Mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor lifted her languid eyes to look at this
new-comer.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was a little, old, dried up, jet-black negro, looking as
though she had grown hard and strong with age. She was
dressed in a bright plaid linsey petticoat, with a blue cotton
short gown, and a check handkerchief tied over her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sarvint, Mist’ess,” she repeated; “kin I be of any
service?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who are you, my good woman?” asked Lady Montressor, gently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My name’s Aunt Amphy, honey, ’deed it is, child—Aunt
Amphy. I’s be known to all the country roun’, for
a ’spectable, ’sponsible, age-able ole ’oman, as knows how to
’duct herself proper’—and as any lady may put conference in.
’Deed is <em>I</em>, honey.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>“I do not doubt it,” said Lady Montressor, contemplating
this original with a good deal of curiosity—“you said
your name was——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aunt Amphy, child: ’deed it is! least ways that’s what
they do call me, aldough de name give me by my sponsors
in Babtism wer Amphitryte, arter the Queen of the Ocean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Well, can I do any thing for you, Amphy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lor bless you, no, child! no, honey! not a single
thing! I’s independent, thanks be to my ’Vine Marster.
I come to see if I could be of any sarvice to you, child, in
showing you the house and furniter—seeing how you’ve
rented of it jes as it stands—and if I could make de beds,
or get supper ready for you, or any thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you: you are very kind. I accept your services,
and will reward them; there is my maid; you can
consult and assist her. Susan, come hither, my girl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan came forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here is this good woman, Amphy, who will show you
through the house and render you any assistance you may
need.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, child—’deed will <em>I</em>,” put in the woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, come along then, and show me where the
kitchen is, first of all,” said Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, honey—keep close arter me. And don’t you be
’fraid now, if de house is haunted,” said Amphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was not far to go. Amphy simply crossed the hall,
and opening the opposite door on the left hand side, ushered
her companion into the room used as a kitchen;—such
a poor place! so clean, yet so bare of furniture; a wide
fire-place with iron fire-dogs, and surmounted by a mantle-piece
upon which stood a row of brass candlesticks, a corner
cupboard—the upper part with glass doors—containing
common white delf ware, a wooden table and four wooden
chairs, were all the visible articles of furniture.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>“Dar honey! What do you say to <em>dat</em> for a ’spectable
kitchen?” exclaimed the old woman in triumph.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are the cooking utensils?” asked Susan, eluding
the other’s question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The <em>which</em>, honey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The tea-kettle, and saucepan, and toasting-fork, and
so on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, child, surely! Dey’s in de bottom o’ de cupboard.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, then, if you will show me where to get some wood
and water, I will have the fire made and the kettle on by
the time the hampers arrive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll go get de wood and water, child—you jes go and
wait to unpack de hampers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well; thank you; go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The fire was soon kindled; the hampers were brought in
and unpacked; and Susan’s dexterous and willing fingers
quickly prepared a light repast of black tea, toast, and two
poached eggs, which she neatly arranged upon a waiter and
carried in and set before her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now <em>do</em>, sweet lady, try to eat something,” she said,
affectionately—“these eggs look like snowballs; this toast
is browned to a turn, and this tea—better never came from
Canton—try now while I go and see what prospect there is
for comfortable sleeping.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And leaving the sad-browed lady, she called Amphy from
the hall, and directed her to show the way to the best
chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old woman merely opened the door connecting the
parlor in which they stood with the back room, and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dar! Dat Miss Barbara’s own sleepin’ room, and it’s
de bes’ in de house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was as bare and as clean as the other apartments.
An open fire-place, filled with fragrant pine boughs, and
flanked on either side by a linen and clothes press; a four-posted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>bedstead with a comfortable bed, well made up and
covered with a white counterpane; a tall, three-legged
toilet table laid with a coarse white cloth, and furnished
with a small looking-glass; a pine washstand, with a plain
delf-ware basin and ewer, and two wicker chairs, completed
the appointments for comfort.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is all very clean and neat to say the least and
<em>most</em> of it,” remarked Susan, looking around. “But—has
the room, and especially the bed, been aired lately?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De Lor, child! It bin aired <em>all de time</em>! De trouble
<em>we</em> has is jes to keep de air <em>out’n</em> dis ole house,” said
Amphy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe you! But it is necessary to make up a fire
and take the bed to pieces to change the sheets, for they
may be damp.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Damp! he-he-he! De Lors, honey! <em>ole</em> as de house
is, dere ain’t not the least bit o’ damp, or must, or moulder,
anywhere about it. It are so high up here, dat eberytime
it rain, ebery singley bit’n de water run right off’n it! an’
it so dry we kin hardly git a bit o’ wegables to grow here.
Damp! Lors, honey!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, I’m glad to hear it is not so; but at all events it
is cold. So you take that pine out of the fire-place and
kindle a fire, while I take the clothes off the bed. Where
is the linen closet?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dis a-one,” replied Amphy, pointing out the right
hand press, and then lifting the mass of pine boughs to
carry them from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a short time the chamber was made comfortable.
And Susan closed it up, and, accompanied by Amphy, left
the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, child, dere’s anoder bed-room correspondin’ to
dis, as open out’n de kitchen on de other side o’ de hall,
you know, as used to be the Captin’s room, Heaven rest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>his soul! and which I reckon would suit you. It’s clean as
a penny, too, only full of sailor’s truck.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Mother Amphy, I shall do very well,” said
Susan, as they entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan went immediately to the side of Lady Montressor,
whom she found with her elbow resting on the edge of the
table, her head bowed upon her hand, and her face in the
deep shadow of her drooping ringlets. She was sunk in
profound thought, and the little refection stood almost untouched
beside her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan heaved a deep sigh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is the way! always the way! I may prepare her
the nicest little repast in the world, and she scarcely ever
eats; I may make up the softest bed, and she hardly ever
sleeps! and I—I wear out my life tending and watching
her, to no purpose! I don’t know what she lives on, I am
sure, unless it is on grief and obstinacy, and she is dreadfully
obstinate! If ever again I tack my fortunes on to
those of a runaway lady—may I——but the Lord bless
her! and the Lord forsake me if ever I forsake her,”
thought Susan, as she silently removed the service, and
beckoned Amphy to follow her from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come into the kitchen and take a cup of tea with me,
Mother Amphy. My heart is heavy, and I want somebody
to talk to,” said Susan, when she had closed the parlor
door behind her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thankee, honey, wid all de pleasure in life, since you’s
so ’bliging. I should ’joy a rale good cup o’ tea; and I
warrant de Madam keeps de werry best,” said the old
woman, as she followed Susan into the kitchen.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they had drawn out the table, arranged it, and
seated themselves, Amphy said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“De lors! ain’t she purty dough?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De child in dere—de Madam I mean—<em>wonderful</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>purty!—but what’s de matter wid her, honey? she seems
to be in a heap o’ trouble! Is de child a widder?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hem-m! Yes, she’s a widow (—<em>bewitched</em>—there’s
another consequence of following a runaway lady! I shall
have to lose my soul with lying, or, what is as bad, distorting
the truth,)” thought Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A widder! <em>poor</em> thing! she take it wonderful hard!
How long she bin a widder, honey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Some months.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dis <em>is</em> wonderful good tea! Some mont’s! and she
ain’t begin to git over it yet? And I spose dat what she
come down to this lonesome place for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De Lors! Well ’tis ’stonishin’ how dey do take on at
fust—dese young widders! but lors! it don’t las long,
’specially when dey’s young and handsome as <em>she</em>—and
she’s <em>wonderful</em> handsome! It ’minds me of a purty
young widder as I know’d of; her husband done die of de
fever. Lors! Lors! Lors! how she did take on at fust,
to be sure! Nobody couldn’t hold her! nobody darsent
come nigh her! Byme-by, she take and buy a lonesome
country place, ’way off in a woody park, by itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And she go dere to ’tire from de worl’; ’fuse to see any
company; ’fuse to see her own dear friends; spent de live
long day in walkin’ up and down de locust avenue, a thinkin’
on her husband in his grave. Byme-by, toward de fall,
dere came back from furrin parts, a young Capt’in Lovel,
who was a sort o’ quaintance o’ hern; and he sends and
begs de privilege o’ jes shootin’ game in her woods, an’ he
won’t come nigh de house, nor ’sturb anybody. And she
guv him leave; ’cause she was too sorrowful to care ’bout
it, one way or t’other. So he kept roamin’ through de
woods, wid gun and dog, day arter day. At last he happen
to meet she in her solemncolly walks. First ’twas only a
bow one side, and a sigh t’other, as they passed each other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>Next ’twas a bow one side, and a melanchollum <em>smile</em>
t’other. Next it was—‘Good-mornin, madam,’ and ‘How
do you do, sir?’</p>

<p class='c013'>“Arter a bit it growed—‘A fine day, madam’—‘What
sport have you had, sir?’ ‘Good, though excessive fatiguin’,
madam,’ &#38;c. ‘Wont you walk in an’ res’ sir?’ And so
de handsome Capt’in gradu’ly got to visitin’ de house; till
byme-by, de May followin’ bless patience if dey wa’n’t married!
True for you, honey! I aint a tellin’ of you a bit
o’ lie! ’Stead o’goin down in de church <em>yard</em> with her
dead husband she went into de church altar wid a live one;
and ’stead o’ ’mitten’ suicide she went an’ mitted matrimony!
Dem’s um! Ah, dat young Capti’n was a deep one! <em>He</em>
know’d pretty little widders! and so do I; I knows dere
ways! Dey gits over it! And so will de child in dere.
You mind! if some handsome young capt’in don’t come
before long to hunt <em>her</em> up—why she get tired o’ stayin
and go into the world agin to hunt some young Capt’in up.
Dat’s all! Dar! don’t you be oneasy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your theory don’t apply to my mistress, though, Mother
Amphy. <em>She</em> is not an ordinary woman, nor are her sorrows
common ones,” said Susan, carried past the bounds of
prudence by her indignation at the idea of her own illustrious
and most unhappy lady being compared to any other
“widder.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De Lors! child has she seen any heavier trouble dan
de loss of husband?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She lost husband, mother, father, and many relatives
and friends at one fell blow. She is mourning now for them
all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De ’Vine Marster in Heaben, honey! what dat you tell
me!” exclaimed the old woman, rolling up her eyes in
horror.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am telling you the truth.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>“Was it a shipwreck?” asked Amphy, her thoughts recurring
to the Mercury.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Worse than that, it was an earthquake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>A yethquake—My!</span> Where did it happen of, honey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In a land beyond the seas. Now you must know that
I hate to talk about these things, Amphy. So drink your
tea, that is a good soul, and let me drink mine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, honey, yes; ’tis wonderful good tea indeed, ’specially
with white sugar in it. I’se wery sorry for de chile—wery!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After all,” thought Susan, “I might as well have given
her this reason for my lady’s deep mourning, and sorrow-stricken
countenance, as to have her always wondering
about it, and perhaps talking of it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She then changed the conversation, and inquired about
the neighbors, which she discovered to be a “minus quantity”
in that district; and then about the traditional ghost,
that haunts every old half-ruined, country mansion, and
which ought, of course, to be on duty at the Headland
House, and which she found, in this instance, to be “a lady
all in white, who wandered about the house and grounds at
night, weeping and wringing her hands.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Lord forbid that I should believe in ghosts; but
still I’d rather not have heard the story; for if I happen
to go through the upper rooms, in the dark, or look out of
any of the windows, it will scarcely be in human nature not
to take a patch of moonlight, or the silvery bark of a white
maple or beech tree, for the ghost of the white-robed lady,”
said Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, child! if <em>dat’s</em> de worst you see.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But who was she when she was alive?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, honey, she lib many and many a year ago! Her
name Miss Blanche Brande. She was crossed in love, you
see, child, and she’s jes pined away and died, and has been
walking here eber since.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>“A very weak-minded ghost! I don’t think I shall be
afraid of Miss Blanche,” said Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wait till midnight, honey! only jes wait till midnight.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was now very late, the old woman arose to take
leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Der’s wood enough in for yer mornin’ fire, honey, and
please de Lor’ I’ll step up here yerly in de mornin’, and
fetch yer anoder pail of fresh water to put de kettle on.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, yes; if you and your old man can engage
to bring the water and cut the wood, and assist me in the
little house-work when your services are needed, my mistress
is liberal, and will pay you well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wasn’t thinkin’ nothin’ ’bout no pay, honey. Howsever,
jes as you please ’bout dat. I’ll be round yerly in
de mornin’,” said Amphy, preparing to depart, by tying her
check handkerchief closely under her chin, and taking up
her thick walking-stick.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night, child. I’d a heap liefer it be <em>you</em> nor <em>me</em>
stayin’ in dis lonesome ole house all night. Marster bress
you, honey.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And with this benediction, the namesake of the ocean
goddess departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan was not more than ordinarily superstitious—that
is to say—in broad daylight, or in a room full of company,
she did not believe in “ghosts;” but at ten o’clock of a dark
night, alone in a room of an old dilapidated country house,
reputed to be haunted, she felt at least uncomfortable.</p>

<p class='c013'>She quickly set the kitchen in order, and went into the
parlor to rejoin her mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found Lady Montressor in the very same attitude in
which she had two hours before left her—with her elbow
resting upon the table, her head bowed upon her hand, and
her dark ringlets overshadowing her face. It seemed that
in two hours she had not once moved. The fire had burned
so nearly out, that nothing remained but a few embers.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>“Dear lady, it is after ten o’clock—will you retire?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” with a deep sigh answered Lady Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your chamber is well-aired and warmed—shall I show
you into it now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” with another weary sigh, replied the lady, rising.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan opened the communicating door, and ushered her
mistress into the bed-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a cheerful fire burning on the broad fire-place
and diffusing a ruddy glow throughout the large room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope you find every thing here as comfortable as circumstances
will admit of, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes”—in the same exhausted manner answered the
mourner—then, in her thoughtfulness of her devoted servant,
she added—“I thank you, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The maid hurried away into the hall, and returned with
the large traveling-basket in which she had packed her mistress’s
night-dress and toilet articles. These she quickly
produced and laid out. Then she assisted her lady to undress,
and when she was quite ready for bed, prepared as
usual to leave her alone for her evening devotions, which
were the very last acts of Lady Montressor, before lying
down to her nightly rest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think you will sleep well to-night, my lady?”
inquired Susan, affectionately.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As well as usual, my girl,” answered Lady Montressor,
evasively.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night, then, my lady; may the angels guard
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night——but stay; are your sleeping accommodations
comfortable?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I thank your ladyship; I have the room directly
opposite to yours, across the hall; if you should be wakeful,
or need any thing in the night, dear lady, please knock
me up—I shall be sure to hear you.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“Thank you, my child, I will, if there should be any need.
Now go to your rest. Good-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night, dear Madam—and may the Lord be with
you,” said Susan, as she retired and closed the door behind
her.</p>

<p class='c006'>Susan crossed the hall and entered her own chamber,
which was even more scantily furnished than the other
rooms. There was a wide fire-place filled with evergreens
and flanked by two closets, as in the others. And there
was a four-post bedstead with a bed well made up and covered
with a comfortable blue and white check counterpane;
and there was an arm-chair and a table upon which stood
a quadrant, a compass, an old chronometer, Bouditch’s
Navigation, and other sailors’ belongings. On the mantle-piece
were various curiosities, such as a mummy’s hand, a
New Zealander’s skull, a Chinese woman’s skeleton foot,
and other such enlivening articles of virtu, collected by the
late Captain Brande, in his various voyages.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ugh! it’s enough to chill one’s blood, even without the
ghost of the white-robed lady! Well! it’s a comfort at last
that one can say their prayers,” said Susan, looking around
upon the weird scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And as I hope to be saved,” she added, as she examined
the room—“there are no shutters outside the windows, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>no curtains within! So that if the ghost of Blanche chooses
to look in through the panes of glass I shall have to shut
my eyes to avoid seeing her! Well, praise be to Heaven
there remains prayer at least, and no one can be very much
afraid who prays very hard!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And with this consoling conclusion, Susan examined the
bed, and finding the sheets all fresh and sweet, hastily undressed
herself, said her prayers, put out the candle, and
jumped into bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But she could not sleep. Reason with herself as she
might, the utter isolation of the house, the emptiness of all
the chambers, the profound solitude of her own room; the
vague dread of runaway negroes, of whose occasional acts
of violence she had sometimes read with horror; the story
of the white-robed lady, whose ghost was said to wander
through the house and grounds;—thoughts that at noon
day, or in company, would have moved her mirthful scorn,
now at midnight when she was alone, filled her heart with
superstitious terror, which she could neither explain nor
discard.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the right hand of her bed was a large window, unprotected
by either curtain or blind, and as often, as in her
restless tossing about, she turned to that side, the whole
outer scene in that direction was visible to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>And such a scene! a table land, with here and there a
solitary spectral pine, or cedar-tree, and in the midst an old
family graveyard, with ghostly tombstones gleaming dimly
white under the clouded starlight. The sea was not visible,
but its monotonous and mournful murmur was all but too
audible, and formed a strangely appropriate accompaniment
to the gloomy aspect.</p>

<p class='c013'>At each turning, and each glance out upon the wild, dark
landscape, Susan grew more nervous, and consequently more
superstitious and fearful.</p>

<p class='c013'>And presently, a little after midnight, the wind arose with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>a sigh and a moan, that seemed like the voice of some denizen
of that graveyard, waking from his death-sleep, to walk
the earth at night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan covered her head and held her breath. Then half-suffocating,
she uncovered it, and looked out. There were
the ghostly tombstones gleaming dimly under the clouded
sky.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, my goodness alive! I shall go crazy if I stay
here!” cried Susan, rising up into a sitting posture and
throwing the bed-clothes off her. She peered cautiously
toward the window pane and looked out. This position
gave her a much more extensive view than she had before
possessed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But after the first glance, Susan fell back with a half-suppressed
scream, and buried her face in the bed-clothes.</p>

<p class='c013'>She had seen the form of a white-robed, graceful, female
figure moving slowly up and down among the tombstones!</p>

<p class='c013'>Her eyes were blinded by the blankets pressed around
them, yet she could not shut out the vision of that white-robed,
beautiful form with its flowing black hair, and clasped
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan’s first impulse was to fly to her lady’s room and
rouse her; but terror had deprived her of the use of her
limbs, and so she lay shuddering and helpless. Presently
she remembered the Almighty Protector, and fell to praying.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, it is certain that the sincere prayer of a simple,
faithful soul, is the antidote for all fear; and in praying, the
wild throbs of the girl’s heart subsided.</p>

<p class='c013'>And with returning calmness came the power of motion,
and the first impulse of seeking her lady’s presence and protection;
but then arose the generous thought of not disturbing
her rest. And forming a resolution of self-restraint
and patience, Susan recommended herself to the care of
Heaven, and ventured once more to creep to the side of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>bed and look toward the window. The spectral form had
disappeared, and with a sigh of relief, Susan sank back
upon her pillow. The reaction of so great a nervous excitement
produced its natural effects, and Susan sank into
the deep sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The broad light of morning falling full upon her face
awoke her. She started on seeing herself in a strange bed
and room, and for some moments could not recollect how
she came there; but when memory returned, she arose at
once, feeling how heavily and how long she must have
slept, and how late it must be.</p>

<p class='c013'>She hurried on her clothes and went softly across the
hall to the room of her mistress, whom she found apparently
sleeping.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she returned and entered the kitchen. No sooner
had her footfall sounded on the plank floor than a knock at
the back door arrested her attention. She went and
opened it, to find old Amphy there with a pail of water,
waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“De Lors, child! how late you—dem does get up, my
patience alive! Here I’s bin t’ree times to de door, and
dis time I jis sots myse’f down to wait—ef it’s all day!
But I do spose how you was tired.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, very tired! come in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old creature entered and proceeded to fill the kettle,
while Susan lighted the fire.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How you sleep last night? You didn’t see nuffi’n, did
you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush—I’ll tell you after a bit. I don’t believe I really
saw any thing, but I believe I <em>fancied</em> I saw that white vestured
female figure gliding among the tombstones,” said
Susan, with a retrospective shudder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>’Tis she!</em> Sure as ebber you lib in dis worl’ <em>’tis she</em>!”
exclaimed the old woman in a voice of deep horror.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nonsense! it was imagination, optical illusion, no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>doubt,” replied Susan, whose superstitious terrors had disappeared
with the shadows of night, and whose right reason
had returned with daylight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t matter what you call it, child,—wedder ’magination,
optional solusion, or ghos’—it’s all one and de same
thing, and I rudder see a live lion o a robber, nor one o’
<em>dem</em>. Has you any browned coffee?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; I will get you to brown some,” said Susan, going
to a hamper and taking out a packet, which she handed to
her assistant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then leaving the old woman to her task, Susan once
more visited the room of her mistress, whom she now found
awake.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have I disturbed you, by coming in, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, dear girl, I am about to rise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did you sleep well, Madam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As usual, Susan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing disturbed you in the night, I hope, my lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, Susan.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, of course not, <em>her</em> windows have shutters to them,
and are, besides, on the opposite side of the house to the
graveyard,” thought Susan, with a momentary relapse into
credulity.</p>

<p class='c013'>But her mistress was now rising, and Susan busied herself
in assisting at her toilet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mary Queen of Scots has been criticised for dressing as
carefully each day, in her prison of Fotheringay, as at her
palace of Holyrood. I have no doubt that it was a mere
mechanical matter of habit, rather than of care or thought.
Certainly it was only from force of habit that Lady Montressor,
in the course of her simple matinal toilet, seated
herself in a chair and yielded up her beautiful head of ebon
hair, to be carefully dressed by her maid, whose affectionate
hands braided up the back locks and rolled them in as neat
a knot, and divided and disposed the front locks in as beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>ringlets, as if, instead of hiding in this half ruined
house, her ladyship had been going to receive morning visitors,
in her boudoir of Montressor Castle. And with the
same careful attention, she arranged the black cashmere
morning dress, with its white lace collar and cuffs.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, as was her custom, she left the lady to her
devotions, and passed into the parlor to open the shutters,
light the fire, and set the solitary table for her morning
meal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she returned to the kitchen, where she found that
the old busybody there had set the coffee, made biscuits
and put them to bake, and was now engaged in preparing
a fat partridge for the gridiron.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear me! where did that quail come from?” asked
Susan, in surprise and delight that this luxury was provided
for her lady’s table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dunno what you call <em>quail</em>, but if you mean dis ere
<em>peertridge</em>, better ax my old man dere, honey; he kin handle
a gun now et a hunner year ole, good as any young feller
going’, I tell yer all good; you hears me, don’t you?”
replied the old woman, proudly and fondly rolling her head
toward the back door, whither now Susan directed her
eyes to see old Neptune standing there, leaning on his
fowling-piece, and smiling meekly as was his wont.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man took off his hat and handkerchief, and
bowed with his usual gentle salute of—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sarvint, Mist’ess.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, father—you brought these?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mist’ess—I trought how de Madam, looking
delikky, would like somethin’ relishing for her breakfas’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll tell her you brought it; you are so very good. I
am sure she will value your kindness.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Taint nuffin much, Mist’ess; wish I could do more for
de Madam; she do look <em>wonderful</em> delikky.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the old creature spoke sincerely; such an instance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>of thoughtful kindness was nothing unusual in his or his
race; for there is not on all the earth, perhaps, a set of
creatures more “kindly affectionate” than the old family
servants of Maryland.</p>

<p class='c013'>This old man seemed delighted with the pleasure he had
given, and setting down his gun, went and busied himself
with chopping and piling up wood, and making himself
“generally useful.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Mist’ess,” he said, “you has wood enough to las’
you all day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am very much obliged to you, indeed. But I am not
<em>Mistress</em>,” said Susan, smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What shall I call you, then, honey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My name is Susan Copsewood, and I am only Lady
Mont——Gemini!—I mean Mrs. Estel’s maid. So you
may call me any thing you please except Mistress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Miss Susan,” replied the old man, mildly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye! that will do very well. Call me that, father.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old creature smiled; he was delighted to hear this
rosy-cheeked, pleasant-spoken girl continue to call him
father—not knowing that it was a title of respect Susan
was in the habit of giving to very old men, of an humble
class of life, in her native country.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the breakfast was now ready, this “neat-handed”
maid arranged it carefully upon a waiter and carried it into
the parlor, where she found her mistress seated at the table
in her old attitude of mournful abstraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan arranged the service upon the table and then, with
the purpose of engaging her mistress in conversation, said,
triumphantly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“There, my lady! look at that quail!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Susan,” answered the lady, abstractedly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you don’t look at it—you don’t ask where it came
from.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>Lady Montressor made no comment, and Susan slightly
piqued, observed:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, to be sure, we are in the fabulous country, where
quails fly in at the kitchen windows, already roasted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear girl, what has vexed you?” inquired her ladyship,
kindly, noticing now, for the first time, that her faithful
attendant looked troubled.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, my dear lady, only that you have no more
curiosity about this quail, which I consider a god-send, than
if your father’s gamekeeper had furnished it for the Hyde
Hall breakfast table.”</p>

<p class='c013'>At this sudden mention of her old home, Lady Montressor
grew pale as death, and Susan in alarm, hastened to apologize.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no—say nothing, as you are not to blame, child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was a pause, and then Susan entreated her mistress
to try and partake of some breakfast, and especially to try
the “quail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lady Montressor, rather to gratify the girl than to
please herself, complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>The idea of telling her mistress about the graveyard vision
of the white-robed lady occurred to Susan; but she prudently
dismissed the gloomy subject, and told instead the
pleasant story of the old centennial sportsman, whose gun
had supplied the game for breakfast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor listened, and replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bear the old man my thanks, Susan, and do not let his
efforts go unrewarded.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And Susan did as her mistress directed.</p>

<p class='c013'>After breakfast, and after the young woman, with the
assistance of Amphy, had put the lower rooms in order, and
unpacked and disposed Lady Montressor’s few books upon
the parlor table—leaving her ladyship engaged in reading,
she went up stairs and explored the upper rooms, which she
found completely bare of furniture, and even of window
glasses—the closed shutters concealing this latter named
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>deficiency from the outside; the plastering was cracked, and
hanging in dangerous masses from the ceiling; and the
locks on the doors were all broken; but the floor, and all
the wood and brick-work were perfectly sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the second story, Susan went up into the attic,
which she found in even a worse condition—the window-sashes
being entirely gone, and not only the plastering, but
the lathing broken. But here, also, the plank and brick-work
was sound, although the deep stains on walls and
floor proved that in rainy weather the roof leaked badly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Horridly out of repair, but a good, soundly-built house,
for all that; and a few hundred dollars will make it a very
comfortable one,” was the conclusion to which Susan came.</p>

<p class='c013'>She then went down stairs, and inquired of old Amphy
how she might best reach the village of Eastville, to which
she wished to go, to procure workmen to come out and
repair the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Amphy assured her that the horse “Charley” and the
carry-all, that had been left by Miss Barbary, in the old
man’s care, was at her service, and that the old man himself
would be happy to drive her over there.</p>

<p class='c013'>This plan was no sooner proposed than accepted, and
Susan went in to inform her mistress of her projected
journey.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found Lady Montressor seated near the window, with
the book held idly on her lap in one careless hand, while the
other arm, resting its elbow on the window-sill, supported
her drooping head. Susan proposed her errand, and received
the lady’s ready acquiescence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Amphy promised, during the maid’s absence, to mind
the house, and to cook one of her own chickens for the
lady’s dinner; and old Neptune brought up the carry-all
and horse to take Susan to the village. She prepared herself
and soon set out.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was absent several hours, but found it impossible to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>get any workmen to promise to come to the Headland House
in less than a week or ten days. And with this insufficient
satisfaction she was obliged to return home.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was in the grove near the house a curious arbor,
the work of Captain Brande, erected of six jaw bones of
the whale, set up on end in a circular form, and covered
with a thick growth of the trumpet vine with its shining,
dark green, star-shaped leaves, and flaming red vase-like
flowers.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Susan drove into the park, she saw Lady Montressor
sitting within that arbor, gazing out abstractedly upon the
sea. Susan alighted and went up to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The evening is chilly, dear lady, pray do not sit here,”
she urged, with affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady lifted her large mournful eyes to the face of her
faithful attendant, and without a word arose to accompany
her to the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Amphy had tea ready in the parlor, and soon after
it was served and cleared away, Lady Montressor retired
to her chamber and dismissed her attendant for the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Amphy complaining of fatigue from having set up
later than usual upon the preceding night, took leave and
departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan, also, from loss of rest, was very tired and sleepy, so
she fastened up the house, put out the fire, said her prayers
and went to bed. But with the darkness of solitude, and
the silence, returned her superstitious terrors. She shut her
eyes, and then, not content with that safeguard against
spectral sights, she drew the bed-clothes tightly over her
head. But Susan had capacious lungs that required a good
supply of fresh air, and so the sense of being half suffocated
grew so intolerable that she was forced to uncover her face
for the purpose of breathing. But she kept her eyelids
closed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Good angels! how solitary, how silent, and how dark it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>was! She could not see the darkness, but like the silence
and the solitude, she <em>felt</em> it, in the core of her heart, and
quaked with vague terror.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was long before she could quiet herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>At last, however, she fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>How long she had slept she did not know, for sleepers
take no account of time; and why she awoke, she could
not tell, for dreamers are not always cognizant of causes;—but
as she awoke, she thoughtlessly opened her eyes, turned
over, faced the uncurtained window, and saw the half-obscured,
star-lighted sky, the level table land with its sentinel
trees—the graveyard, with its gleaming spectral-like tombstones,
and there—oh, Heaven of Heavens!—the gliding
form of the graceful, white-robed woman!</p>

<p class='c013'>The panic-stricken girl had no power to withdraw her
gaze, that seemed fascinated to that beautiful form, with its
flowing, snowy drapery, and streaming jet-black hair, and
long fair hands that she clasped and wrung like one in
deepest grief, as in slow measured steps she paced up and
down. Presently, in turning away from her monotonous
path, to Susan’s unutterable horror, she slowly and steadily
approached her window!</p>

<p class='c013'>Just as that wild white face looked in from the outer
darkness, Susan, half swooning, sunk back upon her pillow,
with barely strength enough left to draw the counterpane
over her swimming head; and there she lay half paralyzed
with terror, her heart quivering, almost dying in her bosom
with the momentary expectation of some supernatural denouement,
until at length, as before, the deathly sense of
suffocation, and the imminent necessity of breathing, compelled
her to uncover her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>All was solitude, silence and darkness around her. The
spectral face had disappeared from the window. Still, in
deadly terror of its return, she closed her eyes and lay shivering.
She would have given all that she possessed in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>world for the companionship of any human being. Yet in
affectionate solicitude for the uninterrupted repose of her
suffering mistress, she refrained from flying for shelter into
the chamber of the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so she lay cowering and shuddering, occasionally
lifting her eyelids a little way, to steal a cautious glance
around the room and through the window; but all continued
silent, dark and solitary, until near morning, when the joyous
crowing of Aunt Amphy’s chickens, and the cheerful
red streaks along the eastern horizon, heralding the approach
of day, put her superstitious, midnight terrors to
flight, and enabled her wearied frame to sink to sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>She must have slept long and heavily, when a sharp tapping
upon the pane of glass nearest her ear caused her to
start up in affright.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now very late in the morning, and Aunt Amphy
stood outside, tapping on the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marster’s dear sake, chile, <em>is</em> you dead, or is yer gwine
sleep for eber?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! is that you, Mother Amphy?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sure it’s me, an’ its gwine on to seven o’clock, chile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, is it? I will get up directly and let you in,” said
Susan, rising and hurrying on her clothes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Dar</em>, what you tink of <em>dat</em> for your Mist’ess’ breakfas’?”
inquired the old woman, triumphantly holding up a fine fat
“red neck” before the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What sort of a bird do you call <em>that</em>?” asked Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bird? De Lor! Dis ain’t no <em>bird</em> chile! It is one
of the bestest ducks ’cept de canwas back as flies over
our waters. It’s a red-neck, an’ my ole darlin’ shoot him
dis mornin’ for de chile’s breakfas’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, your old man is the best of gamekeepers. My
lady must reward him handsomely. He certainly is the very
best of gamekeepers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lor’ bless yer soul, honey, no he ain’t! De dear ole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>angel, he never was no gamekeeper! De darlin’ ole creetur
is too free-hearted to keep any thing, much less game,
when dat delikky chile in dere might want it for her breakfas’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! you have mistaken my meaning, but I will tell you
all about it,” said Susan, as she went around to the back
door to admit the kind-hearted old woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>And that morning, while old Amphy picked the red-neck
and dressed it for breakfast, Susan let her into some of the
mysteries of the game laws as they existed in the “old
country.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereupon, the namesake of the Ocean Queen expressed
her astonishment and indignation “Dat any lords an’ ladies
should ’sume for to ’nopolize de Lord’s free, wild creeturs as
was ev’dently ’tended for de good of all, bofe black an’
white; and she thank de Lord, <em>she</em> did, as she lived in a
free country, where no sich divilments ’vailed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan laughed gayly at the old woman’s excitement, and
then soothed her by praising her zeal, and skill in cooking.</p>

<p class='c013'>This day passed much as the preceding one had done.
Susan, in generous self-control, refrained from disturbing
her mistress with the gloomy story of the apparition in the
graveyard, and which now, in daylight, she tried to persuade
herself to have been only the effect of imagination. She determined,
however, not to leave her window bare and exposed
to the visits of such a frightful spectre, however it
might have been conjured up; so she took the skirt of a
long green merino riding-dress, and manufactured a thick
curtain, which she hung up at the window beside her bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Consequently, that night, if the ghost walked in the
graveyard, Susan did not know it; by diligently saying
over her prayers, she fell asleep, and her rest remained undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nor was she again troubled with ghostly visions up to the
night previous to the arrival of Barbara Brande’s vessel.</p>

      <div class='line'>“Oh! had we never, never met,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or, would this heart e’en now forget,</div>
      <div class='line'>How linked how blest we might have been</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>That was a glorious morning, as I said, in the golden
month of October. Susan had risen very early, and was
already in the kitchen when Amphy arrived. The face of
the old creature was all aglow as she entered, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mornin’ to yer, honey! Mornin’!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, mother Amphy, you look as overjoyed as if somebody
had left you a fortune!” said Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Better an’ dat, honey; please my Heabenly Marster, it
is, chile; better ’an dat. Miss Barbara ’riv’—come out’n
here an’ let me show you a beautiful sight!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan followed her through the hall and out at the front
door, where the stopped and stood upon the old rickety
porch, while Amphy pointed out at sea, exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dar; what you tink o’ <em>dat</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan’s glance followed the direction of the black finger,
and lighted upon a pretty craft, anchored off the Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dar, what you say <em>now</em>! don’t she look like a white
swan, dough, a sittin’ on de water! dat Miss Barbara’s vessel,”
cried Amphy exultingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, how do you know it is Miss Barbara’s?” asked
Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How I know? De Lor! how I know any thing? by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>the quincequonces, caze no oder wessel any call to anker
here ’cept ’tis de Brande’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And she was right; for even while she spoke, a boat was
lowered from the vessel, entered by a party, and rowed
rapidly toward the beach below the Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dar, now; ole as my eyes is, I can see dat’s Miss Barbara
in de starn, and dat boy’s little Marser Edwy, and
dem der oarsmen is our own sonnies.—But who de debbil
dat sponshous lookin’ gemman as Miss Barbara’s got long o’
her? Honey, you look, you’s got younger eyes nor me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan looked, and with astonishment and affright turned
away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, what de mischief de matter wid you, honey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’m cold,” said Susan, shortly turning into the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>She had seen Lord Montressor in the boat. Lord Montressor
was approaching the shore!</p>

<p class='c013'>She went immediately to her mistress’s door and listened.
All was silent in that chamber. She turned the latch and
entered softly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Montressor was lying—with her arms thrown up
over her head, and her black hair escaped from her little
lace cap, and flowing over the pillow—in that deep and
heavy sleep, that in the morning often visits the mourner,
who has waked and wept all night.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will not call her, trouble will come soon enough.
That emperor was a fool who directed his courtiers never
to wake him unless it was to hear bad news. Bad news is
always too fast in traveling—we needn’t hurry to meet it.
Though why the intelligence of Lord Montressor’s arrival
should be considered bad news, I do not know,” thought
Susan, as she went to her own room to “smarten” herself
up. After putting on her little cap and silk apron, she
went out into the hall, expecting that by this time the party
from the boat had landed.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was correct—the party were ascending the bluff;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>but, arrived at its summit they paused and talked a few
moments, and then separated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, attended by the boy Edwy, and followed
by his groom with the guns and game-bags, took the
narrow path leading into the deep woods toward Neptune’s
cabin. And Barbara Brande, attended by young
Nep, came up toward the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Amphy, who was impatiently watching for her approach,
now set off in a run to meet her. At any other
time Susan might have been convulsed with laughter, at
seeing this aged octogenarian trotting off, with her head
thrown back, her elbows acute, and every step showing the
whole broad sole of her shoeless foot.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a pleasant sight to see Barbara’s handsome, ruddy
countenance, break into a cordial smile of greeting as she
put out both her hands to grasp those of her affectionate
old servant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then they came on talking together till they reached the
dilapidated porch where Susan stood waiting.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you do, Susan? I hope your lady is well,”
said Barbara, kindly offering her hand to the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady is just about as well as usual, Ma’am; but I
don’t know as it would be quite convenient to her ladyship
to receive visitors—especially gentlemen,” replied Susan,
who, however unjustly and unreasonably, seemed to consider
Miss Brande a sort of traitress in having sprung Lord
Montressor upon the Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nevertheless, I think she will not be displeased to see
me,” said Barbara, good humoredly. “Let her know that
I have come, my girl.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is not yet risen, Ma’am, or even awake.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“True, indeed, I had not reflected that it is yet very
early. Well, my girl, your lady expects me, will you let
me pass into the house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I beg your pardon, Ma’am!” exclaimed Susan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>blushing at the unconscious rudeness of which she had been
guilty, and springing aside to let Miss Brande pass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, come with me, my girl. A part of my business
here is to open some secret closets that you would never
find out, and offer their contents—stores of West India
sweetmeats, pickles, spices, cordials and so on—to your
mistress, if she will favor me by accepting them. And I
had rather deliver them up to you, now, while she sleeps
and you are at leisure, for when she wakes I presume she
will require your attendance at her toilet, and after she is
dressed, she will probably wish to see me,” said Barbara,
leading the way into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Decidedly,” thought Susan, “my lady had little need
to draw her funds from the banker’s. These savages here
will support her! The black ones furnish game, and the
white ones supply the sweetmeats. In fact, I begin to like
these barbarians,” she concluded, as she followed Miss
Brande into the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara went to the side of the fire-place, touched a
spring, and what seemed an oak panel, flew open, revealing
one of those deep, hidden closets, so frequently found in
old-fashioned country houses, and whose shelves were here
laden with rows above rows, of canisters, jars, and bottles,
all filled with imported luxuries, and hermetically sealed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here! this cupboard contains the sweetmeats and cordials,”
said Barbara, taking out a tin canister and a bottle
which she placed upon a chair, and before reclosing the
panel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she went to the other side of the mantel-piece, and
opened a corresponding closet similarly furnished.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This one contains the potted, spiced meats and the
pickles,” she said, taking down two jars and placing them
on the chair beside the bottle and the canister, and then
shutting the panel, she turned to Susan and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The contents of these cupboards are most freely at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>your lady’s service, if she will accept them; and now you
know the secret of opening the doors.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Decidedly I <em>do</em> like these barbarians,” thought Susan.
Then aloud she answered—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you very much, indeed, Miss Brande. There
is my mistress’s bell! I must go to her. Pray make yourself
at home, Miss Brande. My mistress, I know, will be
very happy to see <em>you</em>; and breakfast will be ready in a
short time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, I breakfasted on board the vessel. Don’t
let me detain you from Mrs. Estel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘<em>Mrs. Estel!</em>’ She still calls her ‘Mrs. Estel!’ I
wonder if she is in ignorance that my lady bears another
name!” thought Susan, whose mind was still in the deepest
perplexity. But before she could satisfy herself upon
the point, she was startled by the second ringing of her
lady’s bell, and hurried away to obey its summons.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande called in her old servant, Amphy, who
had been lingering in the hall, and scolded her for going
bare-footed in the middle of October.</p>

<p class='c013'>“De Lor! Miss Barbra, chile, I likes to have my fut
<em>cool</em> on de soft groun’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, your foot will be cool in the soft ground, if you
go on so,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I gwine <em>stop</em> of it, honey, ’deed I is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you <em>don’t</em> it will stop <em>you</em>—that’s all. Now here—here
are some goodies to comfort you and your old man
these coming winter evenings,” said Miss Brande, giving
her the canister, bottle and jars. “And in the boat below,
you will find some winter clothing and some flannels rolled
up together.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, honey—yes. Yes, chile, many thanks to you; and
I’ll tend to it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is the old man?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>“Gone down to de boat to see de boys, chile! ’Deed is
de ole angel, honey!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Susan had passed into Lady Montressor’s
room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, my girl, whose voice was that I heard in the
parlor?” said her ladyship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Barbara Brande’s, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! she has come, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lady, this morning at sunrise.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe I will rise, Susan, for I shall be glad to see
Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam,” replied Susan, so gravely that Lady
Montressor looked at her, and observing for the first time
her troubled expression of countenance, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Susan, what is the matter with you, my girl?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Barbara did not come <em>alone</em>, my lady!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Barbara did not come alone? Well, I really do
not suppose she did—but what of that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A great deal, dear lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heavens! Susan, what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear Lady Montressor, did the possibility never occur
to you, that he who traced us from Exeter to Baltimore,
might even trace us from Baltimore here?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! no, no, no. Oh! Heaven of Heavens, no! Do
not say that, Susan! Do not tell me that Lord Montressor
has followed us hither?” exclaimed the lady in an extremity
of distress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wish, dear Madam, that I could say so; but that
wouldn’t alter the facts; his lordship landed with Miss
Brande this morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, fate, fate! Oh, fate, fate!” cried Lady Montressor,
wringing her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, fate! it is just fate! and it is no use to struggle
against it, dear lady! I would not try if I were you! I
would just yield!” exclaimed Susan, who could never be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>brought to relinquish the hope that her lady might be persuaded
to return to England, and to all the fancied advantages
of her social position.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be silent on that subject, Susan. Oh, angels in
Heaven, how shall I meet this new demand on my firmness!
Susan, where is his lordship?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is the wonderful part of it, my lady! I could
easily guess that he might have followed us here, but that
after landing, without coming near the house, he should
take his servant and his guns, and go off to the woods for
a day’s shooting, is what I cannot comprehend at all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it is what his lordship would never do, if he knew
of our presence, and had followed us hither! There is
more mystery here, Susan! It is just possible that he has
<em>not</em> followed us—yet, even in that case, it is scarcely possible
that he can escape discovering us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! my dear lady, if he does not yet know of your
presence here, it would be very easy to conceal ourselves
from his knowledge, except for one thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what is that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your name, dear lady—your name! Mrs. Estel! Ah!
if you had only called yourself Mrs. Thompson or Mrs.
Smith!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, but my girl, neither of these names was mine;
while that by which I am known is my baptismal name, and
the only one, that I am certain of having a claim upon,
and the only one that in wearing, I shall do no injury to
another!” said the lady, mournfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan sighed, and looked into that troubled countenance
with the wish—with the prayer that she herself could
only bear a portion of her lady’s burden of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assist me to rise, my girl, and hand me my dressing-gown
and slippers. There! thank you. Now go and give
my respects to Miss Brande, and request her to come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>hither,” said Lady Montressor, as she slipped on her morning-gown,
put her feet in her shoes, and sank into the
one plain arm-chair.</p>

      <div class='line'>“One struggle more, and I am free</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>As soon as Susan had closed the door behind her, Lady
Montressor dropped her face into her hands, and sigh after
sigh, and groan after groan, burst from her overcharged
bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Montressor! Oh! my lord! my dear lord! Oh,
woe is me! that I must put far away from my parched lips
this draught of joy that would be as the waters of life to
my thirsting and famished soul! Oh, woe is me, Lord
Montressor, that I must deceive and wound your loving,
trusting nature! that I must turn from the light, and life,
and warmth you bring me, and bury myself alive in the
darkness and coldness of this my living grave! for how long,
great Heaven! for how long! I am so young—I shall live
so many years! how shall I bear this living death, oh, spirits
in Heaven, how shall I bear it! Will my heart break?
Will my brain turn? Will death come and end my anguish?
I cannot tell! I do not know! but better any fate! any
suffering for me, than that reproach should come to your
noble name, my lord! And after all—in my bitter, bitter
cup—there is a single sweet drop! the thought that I suffer
for you, my lord—that I suffer for you, even as I would die
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>for you! Yet if I could see you but for one moment to-day!
could feel my poor hand clasped in your dear hand for one
instant! could meet one glance of your eyes—what life—what
life would thrill again to my dying heart! Oh! heart
be still! be strong! this must not be! we must not meet
again! Oh, heart! learn the heroism of silent endurance!”
While she thus lamented and struggled with herself, there
was a rap at the chamber door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now I shall hear of him”—she said, as with a supreme
effort she controlled her emotion, steadied her voice, and
bade the rapper “Come in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande opened the door and entered. But the
traces of extreme suffering were still so strongly marked
upon Lady Montressor’s fine countenance, that Babara, instead
of the smiling greeting she had been about to offer
started back in alarm, exclaiming,</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heavens, Mrs. Estel, are you ill?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—and no, Miss Brande! Come in and close the
door, for I wish to speak with you—confidentially.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara in perplexity obeyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Draw your chair close beside me, if you please, Miss
Brande, for I must speak low.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara feeling more and more embarrassed, complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know, Miss Brande, that I regret exceedingly
not having given you my full confidence before leaving
Baltimore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should have felt honored in your confidence, Madam,”
said Barbara with increasing surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At least you would have justified it, no doubt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should not have been undeserving of your faith, Mrs.
Estel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am sure of it! But I am called by another name
besides Estel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do not look, or speak in this way, my dear Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>Brande, or you will repel the confidence I wish so much to
give you,” said Lady Montressor, in a voice, and with a
look of such hopeless misery, that Barbara’s heart was
touched, and she said very gently—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak, then, Madam; I will not be unworthy of your
confidence! Your name you said was not Estel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—I said that I was called by another name besides
that. Estel is <em>really</em> my name, else I should not certainly
have called myself by it; but it is my baptismal—not my
surname. I am known in the world as the Viscountess
Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Viscountess Montressor! Good Heaven!” exclaimed
Barbara, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you did not suspect this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Madam, by my sacred honor, I did not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And yet, he who conferred upon me his name and title,
was your passenger to this place, landed here with you this
morning?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is very true, Madam. Lord Montressor engaged
passage for himself and two servants, in my vessel, for
Havana, and his lordship came ashore this morning for a
day’s sport in the woods—that is all that I know! I am
completely mystified, my lady,” said Miss Brande, in augmented
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think, Miss Brande,” inquired Lady Montressor,
with a look of deep interest, “that his lordship knows
or suspects the identity of the party to whom you have let
your house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not know, Madam, since it is not impossible that
<em>he</em>, also, may have concealed something from me; but I
should judge from appearances that he knew nothing of
your ladyship’s presence in the neighborhood.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive the necessity that compels me to question you,
Miss Brande, and pray tell me, did you ever mention to his
lordship the name of the lessee of your property?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>“No, Madam, I never did.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I will beseech you never to do it; for, if once
Lord Montressor heard the name of ‘Estel,’ it would
furnish him with the only clue he needs to my identity and
retreat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive me, in your turn, dear lady, but all this is very
inexplicable!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! it is so, indeed, to you! And I appear to invite
your faith, without giving you my confidence! Is it not
so? Well! I will explain! and you, if you will have patience,
will hear a sorrowful story. But, first,” said Lady
Montressor, even in this anxious hour considerate of the
convenience of others, “have you breakfasted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And can you give me half an hour?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am at Lady Montressor’s service for half the day, if
she will command me,” said Barbara, who felt her heart
painfully attracted to her interesting tenant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen, then, Miss Brande! Do you ever see the English
papers?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Seldom, or never, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you have seen no account of a wretched English
woman of rank, who was struck in her pride of place—struck
at her highest culmination of fortune and happiness—struck
down, down, down, to a bottomless pit of
black dishonor and despair! You have heard of no such
woman?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, no; Great Heaven, no!” exclaimed Barbara,
shuddering.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look at her, then, Miss Brande. She stands before
you,” said Lady Montressor, rising, and fixing her eyes
upon the shocked face of Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no, no; Heaven of Heavens, no! You would not
have been that guilty one, my lady,” exclaimed Barbara,
covering her face with her hands, to shut out the sight of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>that pale and spectral countenance, and those gleaming
black eyes, that seemed to consume those upon whom they
looked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said a <em>wretched</em>, not a guilty woman. Are wretchedness
and guilt synonymous? If so, then, indeed, am I a
very guilty, being a very wretched woman,” said Lady
Montressor, in a thrilling, impassioned voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pardon me, my lady, if I have not understood you,”
replied Barbara, with emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How should you, indeed, until you hear. Attend,
then, Miss Brande, and I will tell you my story,” said the
lady, sinking again into her seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while Barbara Brande heard with painful interest,
Lady Montressor related the tragic history of her two
marriages, and ended by declaring the motives that had
induced her to withdraw herself from Lord Montressor’s
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara listened with a face often streaming with tears,
and when she had heard all, she took the lady’s wasted hand
and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“He weighs nothing in the balance of his love for you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Neither rank, nor wealth, nor fame?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; alas, no!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He stood nobly by you in your trial?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He did, he did; my dear and honored lord! he did!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He followed you across the ocean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he is still in pursuit of you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is. Oh, he is.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, Lady Montressor, how can you still elude him?
The man who claimed you, even had his claim been ever so
just, is now no more; there is not the shadow of a reason
why you should fly so faithful a friend as Lord Montressor
has shown himself to be.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>“His honor, Miss Brande. His honor should forbid him
to mate with one so wretched as myself!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A man’s honor, my lady, is, according to my judgment,
in his own exclusive keeping, and cannot be injured by anything
but guilt or folly.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the honor of the woman, with whom Lord Montressor
mates, should be like that of Cæsar’s wife, ‘not
only pure, but unsuspected,’” said the lady. “Therefore
have I withdrawn myself from him and renounced his
name. Therefore, though my heart should break, my brain
madden, or my life go down to death in the pain of this
continued effort—will I conceal myself from his pursuit;
until worn out with waiting and with searching, he shall at
last repudiate and forget me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you can coolly resolve to drive him to that?” exclaimed
Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Coolly?</em> Miss Brande? Oh, look at me and say if you
think I do this coolly! No, no; no, no! but he must be
constrained to have that fatal ceremony that passed between
us at the parish church at Hyde, annulled by Parliament.
And he must ally himself to some lady—his equal
in position and of unblemished honor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor, if I have read his lordship’s character
aright, he can never do that.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He can and must! he owes it to his family, to his position,
to his rising fame!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady Montressor, you also are influenced by a worldly
education. You have all the prejudices of caste. You
think entirely too much of ‘family,’ ‘position,’ and ‘fame,’
more than Lord Montressor does by half. I tell you, that
next to <em>duty</em>, ‘love is the greatest good in the world,’ and
Lord Montressor knows it. Oh, Madam, how can you disregard
the great love he bears you?” said Barbara, pleadingly.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>“<em>I</em> disregard it—oh, Heaven!” exclaimed the lady,
growing paler than before.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I see you do not really do so! I see the struggle in
your mind! Oh, Madam, yield to your simpler and better
nature! Make him and yourself happy! Come, let me
send into the forest and bring him here to plead his own
cause!” prayed Barbara, with earnest eloquence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande, no! if you would not have me die before
you—no! You do not know what you ask. You do not
appreciate to how much of humiliation an alliance with me
would subject him at home! You do not know England.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then <em>what</em> can I do for you? And why have you uselessly
harrowed me with this terrible story?” demanded
Barbara, more in sorrow than in anger at what her simple,
honest, straightforward nature looked upon as the unnecessary
self-torturing of a morbid fastidiousness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not to distress you, needlessly, Miss Brande; but since
Lord Montressor has not yet discovered the clue to my retreat,
to beseech your assistance in still concealing it from
him. And this assistance that I pray is only of a negative
character, only your forbearance, only that you refrain from
mentioning in his presence the name of your tenant. Miss
Brande, will you oblige me in this matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will be guided by your wishes, Lady Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Another thing I must entreat—that you will never call
me again ‘Lady Montressor;’ nor think of me as the wife
of Lord Montressor. It is a name and a position that I
have renounced. Nay, that I am not even sure that I ever
had a just right to wear! For, look you, when I left
England the question of the legality of my childish marriage
was still pending before the Spiritual Court of
Arches. And law is such an uncertain thing, you know,
that the decision of the bench of Bishops may have been
different and quite opposite to that opinion advanced by
the first lawyer of the day, Lord Dazzleright, who denied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>the validity of the first marriage, and affirmed the legality
of the second. Therefore, you perceive that the only name
to which I feel sure of possessing an unquestioned claim, is
that one bestowed upon me in baptism, and which marriage
does not change—Estelle—call me Mrs. Estel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will do so, since you wish it, Madam. May God
comfort you and guide you through your very trying path,
for I begin to see now that <em>in one respect</em> you are right,”
said Barbara, with earnestness, “for as long as there exists
the slightest question of the perfect legality of that ceremony
that passed between yourself and his lordship, you
can as a Christian do no otherwise than reserve yourself—Baron
Dazzleright and Parson Oldfield to the contrary notwithstanding.
Upon this subject, a pure-hearted woman’s
instinct is worth all the legal opinions and theological
dogmas in the world. You are right, dear lady, and in
your painful adherence to right I see the brightest hope of
your coming years.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye, of my life in another state of existence; and that
seems to hearts—yearning hearts of flesh—so distant and
so vague!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No; I spoke of your coming years in this world.
‘Godliness is profitable unto all things—having the promise
of the life that <span class='fss'>NOW IS</span> as well as of that which is to come.’
Wait patiently for the Lord—He can lift you out of this
‘horrible pit,’ this ‘miry clay,’ and set your ‘feet upon a
rock.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was something in the strong, earnest, cheerful faith
of this noble girl, who had herself received so terrible a
shock, that cheered and strengthened and inspired the
mourning woman to whom she spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle had always had strength to <em>suffer</em>, but now the
cordial clasp of Barbara’s hand, the earnest tones of her
voice, the cheerful confidence of her promise, gave the sufferer
strength to <em>hope</em>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>Feeling now that she would best serve Lady Montressor
by withdrawing and leaving her to take repose or refreshment,
Barbara, renewing her promises to keep Lord Montressor
away from the house, took leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle sank upon her knees beside the bed, and burying
her face in the bed-clothes, prayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently Susan came in with breakfast, which she inferred
that her lady would choose upon this morning to
have served in her chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Susan’s earnest entreaty, Lady Montressor compelled
herself to swallow a little coffee and a morsel of bread and
jelly, and then pushed the waiter from her sight, and turned
away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Close the front door; keep the house dark and quiet.
I will, after awhile, go into the front parlor and sit by the
window, where, without being seen, I may look out upon
the sea,” said the lady, as she dismissed her attendant.</p>

<p class='c013'>What a long, weary, trying day!</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande went over the house and over the
grounds, in consultation with Lady Montressor’s maid upon
various matters relating to repairs and alterations that required
their mutual care.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, accompanied by little Edwy, and attended
by his groom with the dogs and guns, roamed far
and wide through the woods behind the Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle, having locked the parlor doors, sat at the front
window, and, shielded from outside view by the closed
Venetian blinds, gazed through their slats, watching the
sea-coast, if haply she could catch one glimpse of the “one
loved form.” How long and patiently she sat and waited
for that single transient moment of painful joy! As the
day waned, and the sun declined, and the lights and shadows
changed, she sank into a kneeling posture before the
window, and with her clasped hands resting upon its sill,
and her chin leaned upon them, she continued to gaze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>through the bars out upon the darkening coast and upon
the sea, still bright in the reflection of the last rays of the
setting sun.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length, just as she was beginning to fear that she
should not see him before the evening grew too dark for
her to identify his form, her patience was rewarded.</p>

<p class='c013'>A party emerged from the woods off to her right, and
foremost among them she recognized his well-known, commanding
form, clothed in a hunting-suit of green, with the
game-bag at his side, the fowling-piece across his shoulder,
and two pointers at his feet. Behind him came the boy,
the old negro, and the groom, all heavily laden with game.
He paused upon the same spot, whereon in the morning he
had parted with his shipmates, he paused and turned
his fine face toward the house—toward the very window
whereat she knelt and gazed!</p>

<p class='c013'>Oh! could he but have known who watched behind those
green blinds!—but evidently he knew not—suspected not
the near proximity of her whom he so eagerly sought, and
who at this very moment, from behind those blinds, gazed
upon him in such passionate love and prayerful sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>He called the old negro to his side, and selecting what
seemed to be the best specimens from each bunch of game,
tied them together, put them in the hands of Neptune, and
pointed toward the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Neptune touched his hat, and turned to come up the
hill.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Lord Montressor continued his course down the
steep, until he was lost to her sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then her strength utterly gave way!</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is over! it is over!” she cried, and sank swooning to
the floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>When she recovered her consciousness it was quite dark—recollection
slowly returned, bringing its accompaniment
of anguish. She arose upon her elbow, passed her hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>before her face to put away the trailing black tresses of her
hair, and looked around.</p>

<p class='c013'>The moonlight gleaming through the slats of the closed
shutters was the only object that attracted her attention.
She went and opened them and sank down on the floor
with her head resting as before upon the window-sill, gazing
out at sea.</p>

<p class='c013'>There, on the moonlit waters, like some fair white-winged
bird, floated the vessel that contained all she loved on
earth. She could not choose but kneel there with her
breaking heart, praying for him, gazing after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was interrupted by a gentle rap at the door—not of
the parlor, but of the chamber. She arose and feebly
crossed both rooms, and laid her hand upon the latch just
as the voice of Susan spoke softly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you awake, dear lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>For reply, she opened the door and admitted her attendant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear Madam, how long and soundly you must have
slept! Here I have been to the door three times since
sunset, and found all quiet,” said the girl, who had no suspicion
that her mistress had lain an hour in a swoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Lady Montressor made no comment, Susan said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande is in the hall waiting to bid you good-by,
my lady, as she returns on board of her vessel to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ask her to come in,” said Estelle, in a voice so hollow
that Susan started with the impression that it was the graveyard
spectre that spoke close to her ear.</p>

<p class='c013'>Recovering her self-possession, she went out to obey, and
soon returned, bringing lights, and preceding Miss Brande.
Susan set the lights down, handed a chair to the visitor,
and retired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have seen him this evening, Miss Brande?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, dear lady, I have not. He remained in the forest
until sunset, when he returned and went immediately on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>board of the ship. I have been on the premises here all
day, and so have not seen him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think we may be sure now that I am safe from discovery.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam, for he evinces no curiosity about my lady
tenant, although, having been engaged in shooting through
her woods, he has very properly sent her a fine bunch of
game. Old Neptune brought it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>As Barbara had only come to say “Good-bye,” and as
she was in haste to return to her vessel, she took leave of
Lady Montressor, and with sincere prayers for her consolation
and happiness, prepared to depart. She had not gone
many steps from the room, however, before the plaintive
voice of the lady recalled her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande, forgive me, but at what hour do you sail?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At sunrise, to-morrow morning, Madame.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you. May Heaven send you a happy voyage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you—peace and consolation, lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And so they parted.</p>

<p class='c013'>That evening, Lady Montressor, scarcely having tasted
her supper, soon dismissed her attendant, and closed herself
up in her two rooms. And when the house was still,
she went and sat at the window, looking out at sea, and
watching the white sails of the vessel that bore within its
bulwarks her beloved. Hour after hour she sat there, until
the moon sank below the horizon, leaving the earth and sea
in utter darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she arose and paced the floor of that desolate
room, hour after hour, until the dawn of morning faintly
appeared in the east.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then again she seated herself at the window, and with her
head resting heavily upon her hand, she watched until the
brightening day once more, for a few moments, gave the
sails of the departing vessel to her longing eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>And she watched that vessel,—treasuring every moment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>that she might yet behold it—as we watch a beloved and
dying face that we feel must soon vanish from our sight
forever.</p>

<p class='c013'>She watched it until she saw the sails shaken out of their
reefs, and other sails hoisted, and all draw and fill with the
wind as the Petrel left her anchorage and glided gracefully
over the waters in her course down the Bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>She watched it as the sails lessened in the distance; she
watched it out of sight—straining her eyes after it until
the Petrel appeared no larger than a snow-flake on the blue
sea against the horizon, into which it soon seemed to melt
and disappear.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was gone! <em>He</em> was gone!</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet still she did not change her attitude or withdraw her
gaze; but remained with her strained eyes fixed upon the
spot under the horizon where the sail had disappeared!</p>

<p class='c013'>It was very late in the afternoon, and Susan had paid
many visits to her lady’s chamber door to listen if she could
hear her stir, and had even rapped once or twice to attract
her notice; when at length growing uneasy, she gently
opened the door and looked in; seeing the bed unoccupied
she became alarmed, entered the room and passed on to the
parlor, where, at the front window, she saw her mistress
sitting quite still, leaning her forehead against the window
pane, and apparently gazing out upon the Bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, dear Madam, how indiscreet! Have you been
up all night?” inquired Susan, anxiously approaching the
lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the stationary figure neither spoke nor moved.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady! Lady Montressor!” exclaimed the girl, going
closer to her side.</p>

<p class='c013'>But no word or gesture responded to that call.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She has fallen asleep sitting there—she will get cold;
she must be waked. Lady! Lady! dear Lady!” exclaimed
Susan, taking the hand that hung down by her side.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>But that hand was a hand of ice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good angels, how cold she is! Madam! dear Mistress!
Oh Heavens! what ails her?” cried the girl, putting
her arms gently and respectfully around the lady’s shoulders,
and seeking to lift her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that touch the sufferer murmured strangely, wildly,
vaguely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the matter? Dear Lady, what is this?” said
Susan in great distress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone! gone! gone!” exclaimed Estelle in a hollow,
echoing voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! you have been asleep—rouse yourself, dear lady!
Wake up!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone! gone! gone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Heaven! what ails her! What shall I do with
her? Lady Montressor! speak to me! look on me! it is
I—your poor, faithful Susan! Speak to me, please!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone! gone! gone!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Once more Susan put her arms reverently around her
mistress’s shoulders and sought to lift her head.</p>

<p class='c013'>And at that touch the lady turned toward her a death-like
face, from which every shade of color had faded, and vacant
eyes whence the light of intellect had gone out!</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes! the heroic soul that had borne up so long, and
bravely, and patiently, under such tremendous afflictions,
had succumbed at length; the sorely over-tasked heart and
brain had yielded; the light of reason had fled.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Lord Montressor, on board the Petrel, pursued
his voyage to the West Indies. And, reader this was
well—this was best!</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is about time that we should looked up Mr. Julius
Luxmore, whom we have too long left to his own “devices.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It will be recollected that after his rescue from death
among the waves, the first thought that arose in the mind
of that ingenious young gentleman was not the religious
emotion of gratitude to Divine Providence for his almost
miraculous preservation; but, on the contrary, the wicked
impulse of suppressing his real name and giving a fictitious
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>For this act he had, as it was afterward discovered, a
very strong motive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore, from his earliest youth, had been the
subject of one grand passion—the love of money. How to
make the largest possible fortune in the least possible time,
was to him the constant subject of study. The love of
money, as the love of any particular object of pursuit, is
accompanied with an instinctive knowledge of the readiest
road to its acquirement.</p>

<p class='c013'>As early as his twelfth year commerce suggested itself to
the intelligent lad as the quickest means by which to gain
wealth.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>Thus, when in his fourteenth year, he was left a destitute
and irresponsible orphan, without a near relative in the
world, and with only one decent suit of clothes, and one
guinea in his pocket, he applied to his neighbor, old Captain
Brande, and was engaged as cabin-boy on board the
Mercury.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was on this first voyage, that he became acquainted
with Barbara, the skipper’s little daughter and constant
companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Captain Brande was very kind to the fatherless and
motherless lad who had sought his protection, and Barbara,
to whom orphanage seemed the most appalling of all
calamities, treated the boy as a dear brother.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the old skipper’s delight, in his leisure moments,
to instruct these children not only in the various branches
of a common school education, but also in the science of
navigation, and in the art of seamanship—and even in the
long night watches he used sometimes, without too much
taxing their hours of sleep, to teach them the names of the
constellations and the stars.</p>

<p class='c013'>He encouraged a generous spirit of emulation between
the boy and girl, who could never in any one acquirement
be quite equal; for Julius possessed the greater physical
power, and Barbara the quicker intellect; therefore Julius
excelled in the <em>practice</em>, and Barbara in the <em>theory</em> of working
the ship. But the old skipper was not content that this
should remain just so—and in giving his lessons he stimulated
the mind of the boy to a greater activity; and in
directing the firm little hand of the girl, he encouraged her
to lay out her full strength upon the ropes.</p>

<p class='c013'>This constant companionship of the youth and maiden
was likely to result in one of two things—mutual dislike or
mutual affection—it eventuated in the latter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Their ship was bound to London. And on arriving at
that port, Julius cast about in his mind the problem—how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>to invest his precious guinea to such advantage as
finally to turn it into two guineas—for to double his money
in every speculation was with the sanguine lad a fundamental
principle of financiering.</p>

<p class='c013'>An accident assisted him—accident <em>always</em> assists those
who are sufficiently in earnest.</p>

<p class='c013'>One day, in strolling along the narrow streets of Liverpool,
he came to an auction where the goods of a dealer in
Sheffield cutlery were in process of sale. He stood awhile
and watched the bidding, and then with his five dollars
bought about twenty dollars’ worth of morocco cases, each
containing steel scissors, tweezers, penknife, bodkin, needlecase,
thimble, netting and tatting shuttle, knitting-needles,
and, in short, every possibly needful accessory of a lady’s
work-box. Having secured his prize, he took it on board
the ship, where he concealed it until he got an opportunity
of sewing it up in his mattress—for Julius had not the
slightest intention of permitting the custom-house to share
his profits.</p>

<p class='c013'>On reaching Baltimore, these twenty cases, worth in
England a dollar a piece, were easily retailed by the boy
for two dollars. So that, in his very first venture, from an
investment of five dollars he had cleared thirty-five, or
seven hundred per cent.! Why, the thought almost took
his breath! At this rate he should speedily make a fortune.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Julius had to learn that, with all its advantages,
commerce is a very uncertain vocation—that its great gains
are often counter-balanced by as great losses. His next
venture was not quite so lucky.</p>

<p class='c013'>This first voyage of Julius was also the last one which
Barbara accompanied her father. Her mother’s declining
health and subsequent death rendered it necessary that this
eldest child should remain at home to take charge of the
younger ones.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Julius went to the West Indies with the skipper, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>from that time accompanied him on all his voyages, and in a
few years rose from the position of cabin-boy to that of mate.</p>

<p class='c013'>His home on shore was always at the Headland, where
Barbara received him with a sister’s warm affection.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the years passed, the youth and maiden grew in
strength and beauty, and in mutual love.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius, notwithstanding the fluctuating nature of his business,
had increased in riches, and was worth several thousand
dollars upon the day when he first asked the hand of
Barbara from her father.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Captain Brande gladly consented to a betrothal, with
this stipulation—that the marriage should not be consummated
until the end of the voyage upon which they were
then bound, after which the mate, as Captain Luxmore,
should have the command of the vessel, and the hand of the
retired master’s daughter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alas, we know how that promising voyage ended—in
the wreck of the Mercury, with the loss of all on board
except Julius Luxmore, who brought from the waves one
wild hope connected with one wicked purpose. The circumstances
in which he found himself placed on his restoration
to life, formed the first terrible temptation to his
integrity.</p>

<p class='c013'>He saw himself the sole survivor of a shipwrecked crew,
with none to identify his person. He found himself left
guardian to a young girl of almost fabulous beauty and immense
wealth, who had always lived a life of utter seclusion,
on a lovely sea-girt island—her own patrimony—and having
no companions except a half-crazy old man in his
ninetieth year, and a troop of negro slaves, that, like the
fair island, was her own inheritance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Princess,” she had been called by her mad old uncle, but
was <em>that</em> so mad a term, as applied to her, after all? Little
Island Queen was she, rather—for, would not all the land,
from its centre to its sea-washed shores, and all the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>on it, belong absolutely to her?—to her, not only for government,
but for bargain and sale, if she should will it?
Truly, she would be “monarch of all she surveyed,” and
not with a limited, but with an absolute monarchy!</p>

<p class='c013'>And this beautiful little millionaire, this little queen of
eleven years of age, would, in four or five years, be legally
marriageable.</p>

<p class='c013'>What a rich prize would she be! It almost took the breath
of the ambitious and avaricious young man to think of it!</p>

<p class='c013'>He reflected. To wait five years, and then to marry
her, would be the quickest, easiest, and surest way of securing
an immense fortune. This lovely little Etoile—this
radiant star of the sea—this young “Island Princess” had,
as it appeared, never left her beautiful, solitary, sea-girt
home, and had never seen any other human creatures than
her mad old uncle and her negro or mulatto slaves. Good!
He resolved that she should never see any other person, except
himself—Julius Luxmore. He was quite conscious of
possessing a handsome face and figure, with great powers of
pleasing, and he determined to use his advantages to attach
her affections to himself—and if that eventually failed, to
use his power as her sole guardian to bring about a marriage
with her, before he would ever consent to take her
from the lone Isle.</p>

<p class='c013'>To this plan her doting, old uncle could be no hindrance,
as its consummation belonged to future years, while a few
weeks or months must naturally terminate the life of a man
of ninety, who had already fallen into second childhood.
But it might be well to conciliate even this old lunatic, and
to do this Julius Luxmore resolved.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was one serious trouble in his way; it was not an
obstacle, for Julius resolved that it should not be such; but
it was a grief. It was the thought of Barbara Brande,
whom, notwithstanding all his selfish ambition, he still loved—the
thought of Barbara in her awful bereavement—of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>Barbara, the noble and true-hearted, now crushed down
under an overwhelming weight of sorrow—and whom he
should rather hasten to raise up, support and console—than
deceive, betray and abandon—the thought of Barbara that
would <em>not</em> be banished, but that made his heart intensely
ache. For he was not old in sin, or hardened in guilt, this
Julius Luxmore!—his ruling passion had been powerfully
tempted, and had betrayed his integrity; he had sold his
soul to the fiend and was resolved to do his work—that was
all! and truly that was enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>He knew that to Barbara’s noble, truthful, and confiding
nature the belief in his death would bring less of anguish
than the knowledge of his falsehood—falsehood, the perfidy
of which was so extremely aggravated under the circumstances
of her tremendous calamities. He determined
to permit Barbara to believe him dead; and for this reason
gave a fictitious name, instead of his own.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is true, he felt that this fraud might be discovered;
but if it should be, he was resolved to shift all the responsibility
upon others, by affirming that <em>they</em> had made a
mistake in the name.</p>

<p class='c013'>And to defer as long as possible any chance of being
identified as Julius Luxmore, late mate of Captain Brande,
he had, immediately on reaching the port of Baltimore,
slipped out of sight and concealed himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>He made his way to New York, and thence took a vessel
bound down the coast. He landed at Norfolk—there purchased
a small, clean schooner, and having manned it with
negroes, set sail for the East, or Orient Isle.</p>

<p class='c006'>It was the afternoon of a warm, refulgent day in October
that Julius Luxmore came in sight of the loveliest
of Isles. It lay like some jewel of rich mosaic on the heaving
bosom of the bay. The girdle of woods, that skirted
its shores were just beginning to turn, and on the northern
and western side were tinged with a ruddy, crimson color;
the low, descending sun, striking full upon this hue kindled
it up into a flame-like refulgence,—a glorious, indestructible
conflagration. Contrasting with this was the green of the
grass and shrubberies in the interior of the Isle, that still
retained its spring-like verdure. Central in this oasis of
verdancy and bloom, stood the white buildings of the Island
mansion and out-houses.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his ignorance of the usual landing-place, Julius Luxmore
could not decide toward which point of the Island beach
to direct his course. At length, however, he determined to
come to anchor, and go out in his little skiff to reconnoitre
the coast, and perhaps to make his first visit to the mansion house.
He accordingly gave orders to drop the anchor,
and to let down the skiff. And when these commands
were fulfilled, having made a careful toilet, he entered the
little boat, and alone, with his single oar, struck out toward
the Isle.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>On a nearer approach this gem of the sea grew, if possible,
still brighter and more beautiful. The calm repose
and crystal clearness of the water that kissed its shores,
reflected as in a mirror the rich refulgent foliage that girdled
them. Julius Luxmore pushed his boat up close under
the overhanging branches, and so in the deep refreshing
shadows, proceeded to row around the Isle in search of
some convenient landing-place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently he came to a tiny rock-bound islet of pellucid
depth, that might have been the grotto of the Naiad Queen,
or the bath of beauty for all the sea-nymphs.</p>

<p class='c013'>And, oh, Orpheus! what sounds are these that break the
silence like the shiver of a thousand silver bells?</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a voice of entrancing melody—a sweet, rich, elastic,
bird-like voice, caroling a jubilant, exultant air, the words
of which are lost in the rapture of the notes.</p>

<p class='c013'>To enjoy this delightful song without disturbing the
singer, Julius Luxmore pushed his boat up under the shelter
of an overhanging alder tree, where he remained concealed
in the deep obscurity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Presently the song ceased, and the cessation was accompanied
by the sound of a plunge into the still water of the
inlet.</p>

<p class='c013'>He peered out from his hiding-place, but for a few moments
saw nothing except the widening circle of ripples
where the water had been disturbed—and then—oh, Amphitrite,
and all the Naiads! What was it? Was it a
mermaid or was it a mortal?</p>

<p class='c013'>The face and head of a beautiful girl of that sweet age
between childhood and womanhood, yet nearer childhood,
appeared above the surface. This fair creature was clad in
a long flowing white garment that completely vailed her
perfect form as she floated gracefully about, disporting herself
in the bright pellucid water. Julius Luxmore dared
scarcely breathe, lest he should dissolve the lovely vision
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>from which he could not withdraw his fascinated gaze. As
she swam or dived, or reared her radiant head with its
golden hair all spangled with the diamond dew that sparkled
in the slanting sun rays, she still sang snatches of a wild,
gay air, though in a somewhat lower key, as though her
sportive evolutions in the water, carried off some portion
of the overflowing life that had at first inspired her song.
So she continued to sport and sing—sometimes diving to
the bottom and bringing up handsful of the pearl-like
pebbles that she threw high into the sky to see them fall a
mimic hailstorm into the calm water that then leaped up in
a thousand rainbow sparkles!—sometimes swimming joyously
on to the mouth of the fairy inlet, and whirling around
and hurrying back, lashing the water with her white arms
in a whimsical affectation of terror; and sometimes with
bosom level and head only slightly raised, floating upon the
surface as idly and lightly as a lotus leaf, until the sun went
down.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is my Princess of the Isle!—that is my Star of
the Sea!—as poor Victoire called her! It can be no other!”
said Julius Luxmore, gazing in a sort of ecstacy of anticipated
possession on the bewitching creature.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Barbara, Barbara! even you would scarcely blame
me for being dazzled by such a prize!” he continued, devouring
this beauteous vision with his eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At this moment a voice was heard from the Island——</p>

<p class='c013'>“Etoile! Etoile! my Pearl!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here, Maman, here!” responded the clear, silvery tones
of the swimmer.</p>

<p class='c013'>And at her voice, a handsome quadroon woman, middle-aged,
and neatly dressed, emerged from the bushes overhanging
the spot, and came cautiously down to the brink
of the inlet.</p>

<p class='c013'>As she appeared, the little maiden came out of the water,
laughing, and wringing her dripping hair.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>“Little Nereid!” said the nurse, fondly holding out her
hand to assist her in the assent of the bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No! unless you mean the Queen of the Nereids!—Amphitrite,
if you will, nothing less!” laughed the maiden,
as she joined her nurse, and both disappeared among the
trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Was ever any thing out of Heaven so wondrous beautiful!
And is that exquisite creature, at some day or other,
to be mine, my own? Upon my life and conscience it may
be so, for I see nothing to prevent it! Come! even if to
wait five years for her, were not the quickest, easiest, and
surest way of securing an immense fortune, it would still be
well worth while to wait to secure such a pearl as herself
alone!” mused Julius Luxmore, as he came out of his retreat,
and pushed his boat onward on his exploration of the
Island shores.</p>

<p class='c013'>After making about three-quarters of the whole circuit,
he came to the regular landing-place with its neat little
pier, the protective railings and the steps of which were
painted green and white.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here he moored his boat and paused to consider the propriety
of, at that late hour, presenting himself at the Island
mansion.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun had set; but the reflection of his last rays still
flushed with crimson all the western horizon, while the
orient was bathed in golden glory with the beams of the
risen full moon. Under the two lights the lovely Island lay
like a scene of enchantment. Lamps gleamed from the
lower windows of the white fronted mansion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the whole, Julius Luxmore could not resist the
temptation to go forward. He looked critically at his own
dress. In view of this possible visit he had, before leaving
the vessel, carefully arranged his toilet; and now upon examination,
he found that it had contracted no soil, nor in
any other way had it become disarranged.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>He stepped out of his boat, went up the steps to the pier
and walked onward under the tall branches of the trees, that
met over his head, up the long avenue leading to the house,
until at last he reached a terrace crowned with a trellis,
thickly overgrown with climbing roses, still in full bloom.
He had but just reached this spot and noted a graceful,
golden-haired, white-robed female form leaning over the
trellis of roses, when he was suddenly struck and thrown
down beneath an overwhelming weight, to find himself in
the powerful grasp of a huge bull-dog, who had fastened his
jaws firmly on his shoulder. Tightly as the beast held him,
it was with a certain wise and merciful reserve of his fangs,
for though his strong teeth clenched, they did not penetrate
the broadcloth of the coat, far less the skin of the man. Yet
Julius Luxmore felt certain that at the first struggle to escape,
those fearful fangs would be buried deeply in his flesh
and crimsoned with his blood.</p>

<p class='c013'>All this passed in a single instant of time, for, “in the
twinkling of an eye,” the white-robed female figure, whom
Luxmore had recognized as Etoile, darted down the terrace,
and threw herself upon the great brute, half-caressingly and
half-rebukingly, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, Dragon! how dare you, sir? What ails you?
Let go, this moment!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the huge beast, without relaxing his hold, rolled his
blood-shot eyes up toward his little mistress, and growled
a remonstrance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What, sir! you will not obey?” exclaimed the little girl,
taking hold of his ears, and shaking his head. The dog
released the prisoner, but growled a very decided difference
of opinion with his mistress upon this subject of setting the
stranger at liberty. Julius Luxmore, who had at all
hazards struggled to rise, now sprang to his feet, bowed,
and was about to deliver the neat salutation he had improvised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>for the occasion, when Etoile interrupted him by
saying, with inimitable grace and simplicity—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stranger, I am very sorry that Dragon should have behaved
so rudely; I pray you to forgive him; he is not
naturally wicked, and must have been very unwell to have
acted in such a surly manner to a visitor. I hope you will
think no more of it, sir, but do us the pleasure to walk into
the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, young lady,” said Julius Luxmore, with a
bow, “I am here to see Mr. De L’Ile, if he can be spoken
with.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir! and your name is——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Julius Luxmore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The little girl raised a small silver whistle that hung at
her side, and blew a clear, sweet blast, that presently
brought a mulatto page to her presence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go to your master, Frivola, and say that a gentleman
of the name of Luxmore has arrived, and desires an interview
with him,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>The boy bowed low, and went to obey.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excuse me, young lady,” said Mr. Luxmore, with a
waive of his hand, as he left the side of Etoile, and stepped
after the page to say, “Tell your master that Mr. Luxmore
brings him news of his niece and nephew, Madame L’Orient
and Monsieur Victoire.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Again the boy bowed, and then hurried onward toward
the house to do his errand.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore returned to the side of the little maiden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What a paradise is this home of yours, young lady,” he
said, in a tone of sincere admiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! do you find it so? I am very glad you like it;
but it is very strange you should!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You think it strange that I should like this charming
spot!” exclaimed Luxmore, in genuine surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you find it charming also? How curious!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>“Why, yes! Do not <em>you</em> think it charming?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, certainly, <em>I</em> do! but you perceive I know nothing
better than this! But it is very strange that <em>you</em> should
find the Isle so charming?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! because <em>you</em> came from the beautiful world beyond!”
said Etoile, with a sigh of aspiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! and you think the world beyond so beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, sir! I think it is!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Again—why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, because I know it!—it is a beautiful! a glorious!
an enchanting world, beyond these seas!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But how do you know it, my little angel?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sir! I can see from here its lovely shores! vaguely,
indeed; but still, I <em>can</em> see them, and can judge what their
celestial beauty on a nearer view must be!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whe-ew! ’Tis distance lends enchantment to the
view,’ and ‘hills are green far away,’ say the poets and the
sages; and here is a little fairy living in a fairy land, who
thinks all beauty, poetry, and delight resides in the work-a-day
world ‘beyond these seas,’ as she calls it!” thought Mr.
Luxmore, as he stood contemplating the fervent, enthusiastic
little creature before him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you have never been to the world beyond?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never, sir! They say I came from that lovely world,
but it is so long ago I do not remember it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suspect you came not from the world <em>beyond</em>, but from
the world <em>above</em>, fair seraph!” said Mr. Luxmore, with an
attempt at flattery.</p>

<p class='c013'>But his little companion was far too unschooled in worldliness
to understand or appreciate the compliment, and she
answered, simply—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not recollect, sir! I wish, indeed, that I did remember
the lovely world whence I came.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>“And you have never had an opportunity of reviving
your recollections, even by a visit to the mainland?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, sir!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you ever see persons from those shores?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, sir! I have never in my life seen but <em>two</em> persons
from the world beyond—and they were both so beautiful!
just like the shores whence they came; but like nobody at
all on this Island!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And who were those angels, or demigods, in human
form, young lady?” inquired Julius Luxmore, as a pang of
jealousy shot through his heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sir! <em>one</em> was Barbara Brande. She came to see
me once after my grandmere, Madame L’Orient, went away.
Oh! Barbara was something better than any thing I had
ever seen before! She reminded me of a chieftainess such
as I have read of in history—I do not mean of a commonplace
queen, but of a warrior queen—a leader of armies, a
Boadicea, a Zenobia, a Semiramis! Her eyes were the
eyes of a goddess—so full, and clear, and commanding!
Are all women in your world beyond like Barbara Brande,
do you know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius was thinking of that Barbara, that grand girl,
whom the graphic description of Etoile had conjured in all
her noble beauty before him, and he did not reply until the
little maiden had repeated her question, then he answered:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Probably not. There are very few anywhere who
would answer to your description of Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! but I would like to see her again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has Miss Brande been to see you often? Is she in the
habit of coming?” inquired Julius, very uneasily; for there
could scarcely be conceived an event more threatening to
his projects than a visit from Barbara Brande to the
Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! oh, no! She was never here but once—that
was two years ago, directly after my grandmere departed!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>“Do you know why she never came again?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think so! My uncle discourages visitors from the
world beyond!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And he is quite right,” thought Julius Luxmore, to
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Etoile looked pensive.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, fair one! you spoke of <em>two</em> very handsome visitors—the
only persons from the main you had ever seen!—<em>one</em>
was Miss Brande! Now I have a curiosity to know who
was the <em>other</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, do you not know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, indeed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And can you not guess?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not I.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, then, of course it was <em>yourself</em>, stranger! Who
else, indeed, could it possibly have been?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, if that is not a sincere piece of flattery, I do not
know what else it should be called!” said Julius Luxmore,
to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! I do wish to go on the beautiful main!” sighed
Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you have not yet told me, fair child, how—since you
have never been near the main—you know it to be so beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, sir, you forget! I did! I told you that I saw
both shores—dimly, it is true, but I saw them! There is
the coast that I call the sunrise shore!—its beach looks like
glistening silver! the verdure on its higher swells of land
like shining emeralds! and over all the morning sun diffuses
a rich, roseate glow! Oh, it is so beautiful even from this
distance! and how much more so it must be from a nearer
view.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whe—ew! the coast of Accommac! a flat reach of sand
varied only by starved grass and stunted evergreens. But
I suppose the atmospheric magic throws a charm over even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>that desolate shore,” thought Julius Luxmore, watching
with interest the young enthusiast, who ignorant of his
secret comments—continued in her strain of sincere, though
erring admiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And then there is the opposite coast that I call the sunset
shore, and that is a thousand times richer, more varied
and more beautiful than the other. At different seasons,
on different days, and even at different hours, its aspect
changes, and each change is lovely or magnificent. Sometimes
it looks like a shore of gold, when the refulgent light
of sunset glances athwart its sands—sometimes the hues are
of amethyst, sometimes of emerald, then of ruby, but always
is the color of the coast varied with the ever-changing, ever
glorious sunset sky above it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in that pale moonlight, he could see her eyes kindle
and glow, as she spoke. And while he listened and gazed
in growing admiration of this fair creature, so beautiful, so
refined, so cultivated, yet so entirely inexperienced and
simple, the boy Frivole reappeared upon the terrace and
announced that his master was now ready to give audience
to Mr. Luxmore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is well,” said Etoile, who had had some doubts
upon the subject of the stranger’s reception by the reserved
old man. “That is well, and I am glad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This way, please sir,” said Frivole, as he bowed and led
the way across the rose-terrace, and up the granite steps,
through the front portico of the mansion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My master is in his library,” he continued, as he preceded
the visitor down the central hall, until he arrived at
the second door on the right hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Luxmore,” he then announced, ushering in the
visitor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius found himself in a plain, medium-sized apartment,
having two back windows. The simple furniture consisted
of a straw matting on the floor, straw-bottomed chairs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>ranged along the walls, window-blinds, and fire-screen of
painted canvas, a single mahogany centre-table, and one
arm-chair beside it in which sat Monsieur Henri De L’Ile,
otherwise, his Majesty the King of the Island, who now
arose and stood in an attitude of gracious dignity to receive
the “Embassador.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Julius Luxmore gave one quick, comprehensive
glance at this potentate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Island King had aged much since we last heard of
him. His venerable face, surrounded by its circle of snow-white
hair and beard, was bleached and sunken, his imposing
form was feeble and bowed; his dress was still studiously
neat, and even elegant, though in the style of the last century—consisting
of a somewhat faded mazarine blue velvet
coat, white satin vest, white doe-skin small-clothes, white
silk hose, black pumps, and diamond shoe-buckles. He
stood with his right hand resting upon the table, and his
left hand opened and waved—in an attitude and with an
expression that in a real king might have been called royal
courtesy, but that in Monsieur Henri De L’Ile, was something
indescribable.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Julius Luxmore found himself in a dilemma, as to
the manner in which he should address this anomalous personage.
Firstly, it was vitally important that this potentate
should not be offended—secondly, that he should be
conciliated. How should Mr. Julius Luxmore avoid the
first, and effect the last? In truth, this was a serious difficulty—for
should the lunatic happen to be enjoying a lucid
interval, it would be insulting to address him as “Sire,” or
“Your Majesty,” whereas, should he, on the other hand,
chance to be still under the influence of his monomania, it
would be treason and destruction to address him as Monsieur
De L’Ile. Meanwhile he filled up the swiftly passing
moments by slowly advancing and lowly bowing. And
when he could draw no nearer he came to a stand and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_365'>365</span>bowed in silence, hoping that some word or gesture on the
part of his host would furnish him with the cue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not so—for the manner of Monsieur De L’Ile, or his
Majesty, might equally have been the patient politeness of
a prince or of a private gentleman.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius was almost in despair, while the necessity of speaking
was imminent—he bowed for the last time and commenced:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have the honor of addressing——” Here he paused
not daring to add either—“Mr. De L’Ile,” or “His Majesty,
the King of the Isles,” but waited, hat in hand, for the
other party to come to his aid.</p>

<p class='c013'>The other party did nothing of the sort, but merely nodded
courteously, and waited his further words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the whole, Julius decided not to take up and complete
his unfinished sentence, and “shirked” the difficulty by
saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have the honor, sir, of being the custodian of certain
documents entrusted to my care by Monsieur, the late Victoire
L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The ‘late!’ Mon Dieu! the ‘late!’ And is the
prince, my nephew, dead then?” exclaimed the old man, in
consternation, controlled even at that trying moment by his
sense of kingly dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mr. Julius Luxmore now had his cue! he bowed
with the greatest deference, and lowering his tone to a
key of the deepest solemnity, said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sire—it is with the profoundest grief that I announce
to your Majesty the death of his Highness, the Prince,
your nephew, Monseigneur Victoire L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh, hapless house! Oh miserable
princes!” ejaculated the old man, sinking into his
chair and covering his face with his hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a little while both were silent—Monsieur De L’Ile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>from real sorrow—Mr. Julius Luxmore, from affected respect
and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length the former raised his head, saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“How and when did this occur? Give me all the details,
sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius bowed, and standing, cap in hand, before his Majesty,
gave an account of the voyage and wreck of the
Mercury.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mon Dieu! Mon Dieu!” was still the interjection of the
bereaved old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, pardon, sire—Monseigneur Victoire, the prince,
your nephew, left a daughter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go on, Monsieur; go on. You would speak of the
Princess Etoile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius bowed profoundly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say on, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius then explained that he had enjoyed the friendship
and confidence of “Monseigneur” Victoire L’Orient, who
had entrusted him with the guardianship of his young
daughter; that he was prepared to exhibit the will of the
“Prince” at any moment most convenient to “His Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, then, overlook the documents to-morrow, Monsieur.
Bring them to me, in this room, at ten o’clock in
the morning. For the present, I feel overcome and must
retire. Meanwhile, let me hope that you will avail yourself
of what poor hospitality a reduced king can offer. Be
good enough to ring, sir,” said the old man, in a weary but
still dignified manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius took the bell-rope, and rang a peal that presently
brought the little page, Frivole, to the presence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Boy, show this gentleman into the back drawing-room,
and set refreshments before him. Afterward, when he shall
wish to retire for the night, attend him to the bed-chamber
formerly occupied by Madame,” said “His Majesty.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>Then turning toward the visitor, he added:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope you will palliate to yourself any lack of attendance
that you may perceive, sir. I have lately suffered a
great loss in the death of my chamberlain, Monsieur Louis,
whose place I have not been able to supply. Good rest be
yours, sir,” and with a courteous nod and wave of the hand,
the King of the Isle dismissed the ‘Embassador.’</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius bowed nearly to the ground, and walking backward,
as from royal presence, withdrew from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A courteous gentleman—a truly courteous gentleman.
I like him well,” ruminated his Majesty, who had never before
been so adroitly flattered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile, Julius Luxmore followed the little page
across the hall to the opposite room, where the boy left him
to go and bring refreshments.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So—so,” mused Julius when thus left alone—“that
clever quadroon man-of-business, Louis, who gave the late
lamented Madame L’Orient so much trouble, and who
might have given me a deal more, is now out of everybody’s
way—good. And his place as premier is not supplied—better.
I will endeavor to supply it—best. Come, Julius
Luxmore, your star is in the ascendant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While thus he soliloquized, Frivole reappeared, bringing
a waiter with lights and refreshments, that he arranged
upon the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is your young mistress?” inquired Mr. Luxmore
of the boy, hesitating to designate her as Miss L’Orient or
as the princess, for the simple reason, that he was ignorant
of how much this boy might be imbued with the illusions of
his master.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The princess has gone to bed,” replied Frivole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore understood,—whether from credulity or
policy, the negroes of the place entered into the humor of
their master’s monomania. The only doubt left to be cleared
upon this subject was, whether they believed in or flattered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>the royal assumptions of the old man. And this problem
Julius determined to solve—if he could. But Julius Luxmore,
with all his cunning, was no match for the secretiveness
of the youngest negro on the Isle. He dared not, in
many words, ask his young attendant if he considered his
master a madman. And to all his astute observations and
indirect questions, intended to draw out the boy’s thoughts
upon the subject, Frivole replied with a tact of evasion
quite equal to the questioner’s art of investigation. The
boy’s manner was graceful, smooth, and subtle. Mr. Luxmore
felt himself playing with some beautiful, slippery serpent,
whose evolutions were all charming, but who might
possibly turn and sting him. He let Frivole alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>When his meal was finished, the boy offered to show him
up to his sleeping apartment.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Mr. Luxmore arose and accepted his services. He
was conducted up stairs and introduced into the second
floor, front, right-hand chamber, the best in the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the front windows of this room, Mr. Luxmore
looked out to sea, and saw his schooner riding at anchor a
short distance from the coast. Some little anxiety he felt
upon the subject of this vessel, left all night in the hands of
the negro crew; but, after mature deliberation, he decided
that it was best that he should remain for the night the
guest of Monsieur De L’Ile. So he left the vessel to its
fate, and went to bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a long hour before mental exhilaration yielded to
bodily fatigue and permitted him to sink to sleep, and then
his slumber was disturbed by exciting dreams of wealth and
grandeur; and, after a restless and perturbed night, he
was early awakened by the carolling of a sweet, joyous voice
under his window. He knew that voice, and he slipped
out of bed, went to the window, and, concealing himself in
the curtains, peeped out.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>First of all, out at sea, he saw his ship, still riding safely
at anchor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, on the rose-terrace below, stood Etoile, her graceful
little shoulders wrapped in a blue silk mantle to protect
them from the early morning dampness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius hastened to make his toilet and descend to the
portico.</p>

<p class='c013'>As soon as she heard the door open, and saw the visitor
come out, she turned and came dancing up the steps to greet
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore saw by her manner that she knew nothing
of the calamitous intelligence he had the night before revealed
to Monsieur De L’Ile.</p>

<p class='c013'>He thought as she came toward him that she looked
far more beautiful in the morning light than she had seemed
the evening previous. She was but eleven years old, yet
well grown and well developed for that age. There was in
her fair young beauty a look of unsunned newness and freshness
delightful to contemplate.</p>

<p class='c013'>She came up carolling, but ceased her song to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am so glad you came down so early, Mr. Luxmore.
The sun is rising. Oh, come see it over my sunrise shore!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With pleasure,” said Julius. “From what point shall
we view it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, from the eastern extremity of the rose-terrace, here—where
there is nothing to intercept the view,” she said,
dancing down the steps, and leading the way.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius followed, whither she led, to the eastern end of
the terrace, where they stood under an arch of multifloras.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There; look out over the water. Look at the glorious
world beyond!” she said exultingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>From the height on which they stood the ground descended
in a succession of gentle undulating green hills,
down to the pearly beach, whence the broad blue waters
rolled sparkling away toward the far distant “sunrise shore,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>which looked, under the glorious morning light, like the
very foundations of the celestial city.</p>

<p class='c013'>“See, oh see!—if all the precious stones that ever were
created were fused and streamed along the orient, they could
not burn and glow and radiate and flash like that!—could
they? Look, oh look! first along the blue water, a long
line of silvery light; then golden, then ruby, then topaz,
then sapphire, then all the colors of the rainbow flushing
the clouds. Ah! that shore! shall I ever set my foot upon
that shore,” she breathed with intense aspiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, that you shall, my pretty one! I promise you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! have you that power, sir?” she exclaimed, turning
quickly and flashing upon him a sudden, penetrating gaze.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye, I have that power, fair one, else I should not now
be here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But tell me how is that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You shall learn in the course of the day, little lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shall I tread that glorious shore very soon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As soon as it may be proper and expedient that you
should,” replied Julius Luxmore, feeling a curious interest
in the visual illusion that presented a wild, rugged and
desolate coast, under such a celestial aspect to the insulated
Island maiden; but wondering no longer that her whole
imagination invested the whole world beyond with such
heavenly beauty—for after all, the cause lay in the atmospheric
effect of distance, and she conceived the glorious
shores only as she saw them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ringing of the breakfast bell summoned them to the
house.</p>

<p class='c013'>The breakfast table was neatly arranged in the back parlor
on the left side of the hell.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madeleine the quadroon and her son Frivole were in attendance.
But two covers were laid.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madeleine courtesied and announced that her master
would not appear at the table, but would breakfast in his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>room, and begged that his guest would excuse him and command
his house and servants.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore would do that thing with great pleasure
at some future time, he thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>He handed the little girl to her seat at the table, and
took his place at the opposite side of the board.</p>

<p class='c013'>Madeleine was a good housekeeper, and the breakfast
was excellent.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the morning meal was over, Mr. Luxmore assorted
his papers that he always now carefully carried about his
person, and prepared for his visit to Monsieur De L’Ile.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the appointed hour he presented himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>He found “His Majesty” in the same room, seated at
the same table, where he had been first introduced to him.
In truth, the Island King looked not much the worse for
the sad news that had been told him. He was clothed in a
somewhat faded purple cashmere dressing-gown, and now
seemed fuller of business than of sorrow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad of this. It is the way of madness, however,”
said Julius Luxmore to himself, on seeing the state of the
case.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the “Embassador” advanced to the table, “His
Majesty” looked up and nodded graciously and desired that
Monsieur would waive ceremony, draw up a chair and seat
himself, that they might proceed to business.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it is not necessary that I should trouble the reader
with the details of “business” transacted between a madman
on the one part and a villain on the other. It is sufficient
to say that Mr. Luxmore presented his credentials—consisting
of the last will and testament of Victoire L’Orient
together with various documents, all valuable as corroborative
testimony to the authenticity of the will.</p>

<p class='c013'>The credentials were so well received, and the bearer of
the credentials so well approved, that after some excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>diplomacy, Julius Luxmore found himself so high in royal
favor as to receive the appointment to the post of premier,
<em>vice</em> Monsieur Louis, deceased.</p>

<p class='c013'>His Majesty then occupied himself with details of the
solemnities of the royal mourning, which he decided should
be purple; and then he commissioned Monsieur the Minister—<em>videlicet</em>—Mr.
Julius Luxmore, to go upon the main,
and make the needful purchases.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally, dismissing Mr. Luxmore to do his errand, he
sent for the “Princess,” and in a private interview communicated
to her the facts of the decease of her relatives.
This intelligence threw over the youthful maiden an air of
seriousness that was, however, as far removed from sorrow,
as was the golden haze of these autumnal mornings from
thunder clouds. It was not natural that the young Etoile
should grieve over the loss of relatives, one of whom she
had never seen, from the other of whom she had been so
long separated. In truth no one sorrowed. The young
maiden was too happy, the old man too crazy, and the servants
all too indifferent to do so. The “bereavement” spread
no gloom over the bright Island, where it was not fully
realized. Only sometimes the mad old man would suddenly
recollect that he ought to be overwhelmed with affliction,
and then he would fall to tearing his white hair and exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, miserable princess! Oh, hapless house!” And
having paid this tribute of lamentation to the departed,
would resume his habitual cheerfulness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The truth is, that the old man was sinking deeper into the
infirmities of body and imbecilities of mind attendant upon
extreme old age.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Julius Luxmore soon found himself invested not
only with the government of the farm, fisheries, and financial
affairs of the Island, but also with the care of the old
man’s person, and with that of the young girl’s education.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>It really seemed as if the place had needed and waited for
his coming. Had he been a conscientious and disinterested
man, his arrival would have been a most opportune blessing.
But he was selfish, and unprincipled, and he turned, you may
readily believe, every circumstance of his position to his
own advantage.</p>

<p class='c013'>He adroitly and successfully flattered the old man, and
thus attained the first place in the dotard’s esteem and confidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>By delicate attentions and interesting instructions, he so
well recommended himself to the favor of the fair Etoile, as
to become in some degree essential to the little maiden’s
happiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>He also, in conducting the sales of produce from the farm
and fisheries of the Island, changed the place of trade from
the hamlet of Eastville on the eastern shore of the village
of Heathville, about sixty miles further up the Bay on the
west coast. His motive for this change, it will be easily
seen, was to avoid a neighborhood where he was sure to be
recognized, in favor of one where he was a total stranger.</p>

<p class='c013'>In short, Mr. Julius Luxmore did as he pleased. His
rule “there was none to dispute.” The old man was
duped; the young maiden fascinated; and the quadroon,
even if she escaped the spell of his deceit, was, since deprived
of her coadjutor, Louis, notwithstanding her intellectual
brightness, but a meek creature, to be cunningly
managed rather than feared.</p>

<p class='c013'>His schooner had for some weeks remained at anchor
near the Isle; but the negro crew were forbidden to leave
her deck, and so had never approached the beach. Every
day Mr. Luxmore had visited the vessel to look after the
safety of the craft, and the necessities of the men. And
when at last it was convenient to do so, he had taken two
of the Island sailors, embarked with them on the schooner,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>and set sail for Norfolk, where he paid off and discharged
his hired men.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, having thus got rid of the “aliens,” he purchased
some books and pictures for Etoile, and a gorgeous purple
dressing-gown for “His Majesty,” and with the two home
negroes, set sail for the Isle. After a short and pleasant
voyage, he arrived there to rejoice all hearts. And it is
difficult to decide whether was Etoile the more delighted
with her books and pictures, or “His Majesty” with his
royal robe.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is not to be supposed, however, that a man of Julius
Luxmore’s age, habits, and temperament, could be content
to confine himself within the contracted limits of a sea-girt
Island, with no other society than an old lunatic, a young
maiden, and a troop of negro slaves, and with no change
of scene than an occasional voyage to Heathville, to sell a
cargo of corn or fish. With all Etoile’s delightful beauty,
she was but a child; with all his golden prospects, the time
passed heavily; he was wearied, bored; he no longer wondered
that Etoile pined for “the glorious world beyond.”
He himself, who knew it well to be any thing but “glorious,”
also pined for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a word, he felt the necessity of devising some plan of
safe and frequent intercourse with “the rest of mankind.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But this communication with his fellow-creatures, to be
secure, must be, like the “reciprocity” of some people, all
on one side. He must change the scene; must often go
somewhere; but no one else should ever come to the Island.
No one should know of the precious treasure hidden there.</p>

<p class='c013'>But we will, for the present, leave this delectable young
gentleman to make the best of his good fortune, while we
go back after his forsaken love, Captain Barbara Brande,
and her noble passenger.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Petrel was favored with fine weather until the
seventh day out, when near 30° north latitude she entered
the Gulf stream, and faced the trade winds then blowing
from an east and north-easterly direction. The violence
and persistence of this gale kept her back for several days,
so that it was the first of November before she dropped
anchor in the harbor of Havana.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here Lord Montressor took leave of Miss Brande, cordially
shaking hands with her at parting, and asking and
receiving permission to visit the vessel during her stay in
port.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while Barbara occupied herself with discharging her
cargo, Lord Montressor established himself at the Hotel
Macon, and from this quarter pursued his inquiries for Estelle.
He found that the Sea Mew had reached port about
fifteen days previous to the arrival of the Petrel; that she
had discharged her cargo, taken in fresh freight, and about
a week since had sailed for Rio Janeiro. But he could
hear of no passengers that she had brought to Havana;
on the contrary, he was assured by several persons of whom
he made the inquiry that she had certainly brought none.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>But opposed to this testimony were the facts that he had
learned at Baltimore. Thus with a perplexed, discouraged,
but persevering heart he still pursued the almost hopeless
search.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the progress of his investigations, particularly near
the harbor, he often met with Barbara Brande. No word
had ever passed between them upon the object of his voyage,
yet that object was well known to Miss Brande. She
longed for the sister’s privilege of counseling him. Knowing
the utter futility of his search, she felt it to be, in
herself, a sort of treachery to permit him to pursue it. Often
when they chanced to meet, her sympathizing eyes were
fixed with a sorrowful, prayful expression upon his troubled
countenance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once when he visited her, in the cabin of her own vessel,
while both sat at the little centre-table, she fixed her
honest eyes full upon his care-worn face and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, give me your confidence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her open countenance did not blench, nor was her
straightforward look for a moment withdrawn. Indeed
there was in her resonant tones, unflinching regard, and
confident manner something of the authority of the sybil.
Lord Montressor really admired the honest, brave, upright
and downright nature of Barbara Brande. And now it
was something more than admiration, it was a sort of deference
that he felt for her. But she was looking straight
at him, and was waiting for an answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But why, Miss Brande, should I burden you with my
confidences?” he asked mildly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because I can aid you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can aid me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, sir; for I know your history. Do not ask me <em>how</em>
I know it; for I cannot tell you without a breach of confidence.
But, sir, I know the object of your pursuit, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>know it to be, for the present at least, utterly futile—as it
indeed should be!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, I have no puerile fear of misconstruction
at your hands—you are not the slave of a
conventionalism that may be ‘a good servant, but a bad
master.’ You will not, I am sure, accuse me of obtrusiveness—and
even if you did——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if I did——?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should survive it!” smiled Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>But then growing suddenly serious, she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I told you that I could aid you, sir; but for that
power of helping you I had not spoken!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you from the depths of my heart, Miss Brande!
And I am sure that your words will be justified. But—you
know my story! You know the object of my voyage! <em>do</em>
you know where Lady Montressor is?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir, I cannot answer that question without a breach of
confidence. What I can tell you without blame, I will tell
you without question. In the first place, your search here
is utterly hopeless! Lady Montressor is not in Havana.
In the second place, where she tarries, she is well, only
wishing for the present to sequester herself from you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For the <em>present</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>I</em> said for the present. Your lordship will please to
put yourself for a moment in this lady’s place, and you will
see that as a Christian woman, she can do no otherwise
than she does. Consider, sir, that the validity of your
marriage is <em>questioned</em> and rests for final decision with the
Spiritual Court of Arches.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande! a higher tribunal than any earthly court
has already adjudged this cause. The claimant of Lady
Montressor’s hand is numbered with the dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it. Yet how forgetful men are! You should
remember, sir, that this claimant was also once, whether
<span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>rightfully or wrongfully—the <em>possessor</em> of this lady’s hand.
Therefore, my lord, the lady is right, right, right, and forever
right, in having considered that circumstance—while
that claimant lived, a barrier to her second marriage. And
now, Lord Montressor, let me say to you, that all your
hopes for a future union with the Lady Estelle rest upon
the decision of the Court of Arches.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In the name of Heaven, <em>how</em>—what do you mean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This—should the Court of Arches decide the marriage
of Monsieur L’Orient and Miss Morelle to have been illegal——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She will never emerge from her obscurity; as a delicate
and high-minded woman she never can. But on the other
hand, should the Court of Arches decide that her childish
marriage was legal——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, my lord, you are free to woo the widow, and I—Barbara
Brande will give you the aid I promised!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande! Is this your ethics? How is it possible
that a decision of the Court of Arches can affect the
righteousness of an action already past, as its record now
stands before the higher tribunal of Heaven?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It cannot do so, of course. Whatever be the decision
of the Court, the case remains in the sight of God the
same. And this, lady Estelle, whose womanly instincts
have never been confused by the sinuosities of law, or the
subtleties of theology, feels that her childish marriage, however
wrong in itself, was binding in its obligations. Those
who assail the legality of that unhappy union, wound her
in the tenderest point. And should the Court of Arches
decide against it, they will cast upon her a reproach that
she will never consent, by marrying, to reflect upon any one
she loves!” said Barbara, as a sudden and burning blush,
for the freedom of her speech, swept over her cheek and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>vindicated the woman’s under the hero’s nature. For Barbara
was as modest and sensitive as she was frank and
brave. She could deeply feel, as well as disregard the pain
of speaking upon this delicate subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor admired the rare honesty, courage, and
disinterestedness of her really great nature. He paused a
few moments before replying, and then said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have given me some food for reflection, Miss
Brande. I do not know but that you have been the best
exponent of my lady’s motives and conduct, with whom I
have yet met; although I have talked upon this subject with
the Bishop of Exeter, and with the Baron Dazzleright, who
both regarded the affair in an opposite light to that in which
you view it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The reason was, that one was a clergyman, and thought
only of the theological aspect; the other a lawyer, and
considered wholly the legal appearance; while I, a woman,
with only the grace of God to throw light upon my natural
instincts, enter heart and soul into all my sister woman’s
feelings.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I believe you are right, and, by your showing, Estelle was
also very right in reserving herself from my knowledge and
pursuit from the moment that our marriage festivities were
interrupted.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Undoubtedly, my lord! Oh, sir! I feel sure that you
will yet have cause to bless Heaven that she <em>did</em> so—that
she was <em>known</em> beyond doubt to have done so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may be proved to be right—in case that the Bishops’
Bench establish the legality of the first union. But,
Miss Brande, since, as it appears, you know Estelle, since
you have conversed with her, and received her confidence,
you must also be aware that the doubt which rests upon
the legality of her first marriage, is not her only reason for
sequestering herself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know it; but it is the most important one; let it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>removed, and it rests with your lordship to make her forget
or forsake the other. <em>And you will do so.</em>”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor smiled. There was something so confident,
so animating, so inspiring in the cheerful faith of
this good and brave girl. He greatly needed more satisfaction
in regard to Estelle, but he felt that he could not in
justice or generosity seek intelligence of Barbara, who had
said that to give him more information on the subject would
involve a breach of confidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>He cordially expressed his gratitude for the friendly interest
she had taken in his cause, and with a promise to
repeat his visit, bade her adieu. He returned to his hotel
to reflect upon his future course.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day he called up his valet, and said: “Go and
search for a vessel about to sail for England.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lord, the vessel in which we came, the Petrel, is
bound for Liverpool in a few days,” replied the man.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, is that so? Miss Brande told me nothing of the
sort yesterday. However,” added his lordship mentally,
“we were too closely engaged in talking of another matter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is true, however, my lord; the Petrel is advertised
for Liverpool.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes! probably Miss Brande took it for granted that
I had seen the notice, and knew all about it. Go down to
the docks, then, and secure berths in the Petrel. Or, stay,
remain here, and pack up; I will go down to the vessel to
engage a passage,” said Lord Montressor, who was not only
well pleased to have this excuse for visiting Barbara, but
also delighted with the prospect of returning to England
in her vessel in her company.</p>

<p class='c013'>A rapid walk brought him to the docks. A little skiff
took him alongside the Petrel, upon the deck of which
stood the handsome Amazon, busily engaged in giving her
orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sun on this November day shone down brightly and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>hotly on the harbor and the shipping, and fell directly upon
the stately form of Barbara, as she stood bareheaded upon
the deck. No sea breeze now lifted her tresses, but her
raven black hair lay rippling and glistening in purplish
lustre under the beams of that tropical sun, that seemed not
to burn, but only to ripen her luscious southern beauty.
The rich bloom of her complexion rivaled that of the ruddiest
tropical fruit. And in hue like the purple glow of
grape tendrils, were the tresses of her hair against those
pomegranate cheeks. The broad and massive forehead,
the well-defined black brows, the strong flashing eyes, the
straight high nose, firm though rounded lips, and above all,
the erect, elastic carriage; the fearless, resolute look; and
the clear, resonant voice, gave a character of strength and
energy to a style of beauty otherwise too voluptuous. Her
costume evinced her usual disregard to every quality in
dress, except its fitness, and consisted of the customary
gray serge gown and sacque.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was engaged in giving directions in regard to the
stowing of some freight. On seeing Lord Montressor
coming up the starboard gangway, she advanced with a
smile and an extended hand to meet him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, Lord Montressor. I am <em>very</em> glad to
see you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so glad as I am to stand before you, I dare be
sworn, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! but to have returned so soon you must have had
a motive. Now, how can we serve you, Lord Montressor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are going to England?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir; it is the best thing that I can do! I am
going to Liverpool to take a cargo of sugar and molasses
and probably to bring back one of Manchester dry goods.
Can I do any thing for you in England?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You can take me thither.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! you have decided on going home?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>“I have, after mature deliberation, determined to return
to England and await the action of the Spiritual Court, if,
indeed, the action has not been arrested by the intelligence
of the death of Monsieur L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if it has, you will cause the proper parties to set
it going again?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps,” replied Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“At all events, I am glad that you have decided on
going to watch the progress of the affair, my lord, and
<em>very</em> glad to have the pleasure of your company on the
voyage,” said Barbara, with such cordial sincerity, that her
whole warm countenance glowed with the light of the
happiness she expressed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you very earnestly; and, believe me, the satisfaction
you express is much more than reciprocated by myself.
I would have waited some time and foregone many
other good things for the pleasure of sailing with you,
Miss Brande,” replied Lord Montressor, heartily, regarding
the handsome creature before him with an honest admiration,
free from the slightest alloy of covetousness. He
could appreciate her noble beauty and unique attractions
without the least wish to appropriate them.</p>

<p class='c013'>This, Barbara instinctively knew. Hence her frank cordiality
of friendship.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good, then! we are both well pleased,” she said, laughing
and extending her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The preliminaries of the passage were then settled, and
Lord Montressor seeing that the girl was excessively busy
in superintending the taking in and stowing away of the
freight, bade adieu, and returned to his hotel. And the
third morning from this, being the twentieth of November,
and a fine day, the Petrel, having on board Lord Montressor
and his attendants, set sail for Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c006'>As all the readers of this true history may not acknowledge
the same grand passion for the sea, possessed by
Barbara Brande and her present biographer, I will spare
them the description of the voyage to Liverpool, merely
saying, by the way, that the passage was pleasant, quick,
and prosperous. And that in five weeks from the day of
sailing, the Petrel, on the twenty-fourth of December,
Christmas eve, cast her anchor in the harbor of Liverpool.</p>

<p class='c013'>A flood of business immediately overwhelmed Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor took leave of Miss Brande, and promising
to see her soon again, he left the vessel, took a cab,
drove to the Metropolitan Railway Depot threw himself
on board the first train of cars, and steamed away to London,
where he arrived early the same evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>He directed his servants to convey his baggage to Gerard’s
Hall, Aleyn’s Lane, then entered a carriage, and
drove immediately to the bachelor establishment of Baron
Dazzleright, in Berkely Square. He was very fortunate in
finding Lord Dazzleright at home. He sent up his card
and was shown into the library, where, in a very few minutes,
he was joined by the advocate.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>Lord Dazzleright advanced, eagerly extending both
hands, and saying—not only with his tongue, but with his
eyes, his smile, and his whole attitude and expression—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heaven! my dear fellow, I am so glad to see
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And he grasped his lordship’s hand and squeezed it, and
without waiting for him to speak, asked, hurriedly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the last news you received from England,
previous to setting out on your return?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“News? None, except through the public prints. I
have not had a letter from England since I left her shores.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, how was that? We wrote frequently, anxiously.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose there was no chance of my receiving letters.
I left England, as you know, about the middle of last June.
I reached the United States the first of September; left it
for the West Indies the tenth of October; reached Havana
the first of November; left that port on the twentieth, and
here I am!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! I see how it is! You have run away from our
letters, that have never been able to overtake you. But—first
of all, have you seen <em>her</em>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you heard of her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you,” said Lord Montressor. And forthwith
he commenced and related the history of his long search
and only partial success.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then we certainly have a clue that if firmly held and
followed will lead to her recovery.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have a clue; but I am under parole, not to follow
that clue until the decision of the Court of Arches is made
known.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humph—humph—humph,” muttered Lord Dazzleright—“and
you know nothing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of her residence—no, nothing except that she lives in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>strict seclusion, and is believed to enjoy some degree of
health and tranquillity.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! I was not just then thinking of <em>her</em>, though she
generally occupies my thoughts to the exclusion of all
other subjects.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of what then were you thinking?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of what had occurred at this side of the water. But
you say you have heard nothing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nothing, but public news through the public prints!
What <em>can</em> you mean, my friend?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you! but sit down! sit down! Bless me,
you have been standing hat in hand, like the collector for a
charity, all this time! sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor sank into a seat.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright went and pulled the bell-tassel, and
when the next moment a servant entered he gave the brief
order—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Supper an hour hence, in this room.” For Lord Dazzleright
was one of those Englishmen who never could
separate the idea of conversation from that of eating and
drinking.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now then to business!” he said, returning and seating
himself near Lord Montressor. “First permit me to congratulate
you upon the fortunate circumstance that you
<em>did not</em> succeed in meeting Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, in the name of wonder, do you congratulate me
upon any such misfortune?” inquired Lord Montressor, in
astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I deny that it <em>was</em> a misfortune! I contend that it
was a providential blessing—and that the misfortune would
have been to have met Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Explain yourself! why should it have been such, to
have found the beloved one whom I went to seek?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because it might possibly have happened that that beloved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>one, worn out by importunity, might have rejoined
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what calamity would have followed then?” inquired
Lord Montressor, ironically.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just, simply ruin!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Ruin!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ruin; unless you like a stronger word better!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A stronger word!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! there is such a one—listen!” and Lord Dazzleright
uttered the single syllable—“shame!”—close to the
ear of Lord Montressor, who started as if struck by a
bullet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is not so!” he said. “Come, my friend, let us
leave exaggerated views of what might have been, and talk
quietly of what <em>is</em>. In the first place—as you have heard—Monsieur
L’Orient is dead.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are certain of it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I was present when he was picked up from the sea
identified his body and assisted at his funeral.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He is therefore not likely to reappear and claim
Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should think not!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But I had rather hear you say that you are <em>sure</em> not!
After the lesson we received from that gentleman on the
danger of taking things for granted, it is better that we
should proceed only upon certainties.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I am <em>sure</em> that Monsieur L’Orient will give us no
more trouble.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well then, <em>circumstances alter cases</em>! that fact
of Monsieur L’Orient’s ascertained decease changes the
whole face of affairs, and the whole policy of proceeding!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I listen to hear further,” said Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As Monsieur L’Orient can never reappear to claim his
hapless victim, we must now go to work and establish the
validity of his marriage with her.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>“<em>What!</em>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly! To establish his marriage will not <em>now</em> be
as <em>once</em> it would have been—to raise up an insurmountable
obstacle to your own! since the same decision that will declare
Estelle to have been Victoire’s wife—will prove her
now to be his widow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yet still I do not see the necessity of pushing this affair
through the Spiritual Court, since the decision of that court
can in no degree alter the position of the facts as they now
stand,” said Lord Montressor, whose honest soul was concerned
for realities rather than appearances.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is necessary to redeem the name of Estelle from unmerited
reproach—nay, more, it is necessary for your own
honor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot feel that my honor or hers rests, or ever could
rest, upon the chances of a decision of the Court of Arches,
or any other court upon earth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hem! you would not wish it said that you had married
Monsieur Victoire L’Orient’s ——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Silence, sir!</span>” thundered Lord Montressor, growing
livid with emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“—— Victim,—would you?” concluded Lord Dazzleright,
heedless of the interruption.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dazzleright! Dazzleright! you abuse my forbearance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You would not like to have that said? I know you
would not. But then, again, you had not looked at it in
that light? I thought not. Now, however, you perceive
that it is necessary for Estelle’s sake, as well as for your
own, that her name be redeemed from unmerited reproach
by the establishment of the validity of the marriage! We
must go to work as fast as we can and prove that, after
which you may woo and wed the widow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dazzleright! Dazzleright! you are usually styled the
best lawyer in England!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mine honorable friend, the best lawyer in England is he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>who best knows how to use the legal tools,” replied Lord
Dazzleright, laughing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You yourself took the ground that the childish marriage
of Estelle was illegal—to use your own expression,
entirely ‘null, void, and of none effect!’ You even <em>proved</em>
it to be so!—proved it by law, testimony, and precedents!—proved
it to the satisfaction of Sir James Allan Parke,
of the Bishop of Exeter, of the Reverend Mr. Oldfield, and
of myself!—in short, to the satisfaction of every body, except
Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Which you think would make it very awkward for me
now to go to work and prove the same marriage to be perfectly
legal, valid, and binding! to prove this by as strong
‘law, testimony, and precedent!’—to prove it, if necessary,
‘to the satisfaction of Sir James Allan Parke, of the Bishop
of Exeter, of the Reverend Mr. Oldfield,’ of yourself, and
of all others, not excepting Estelle! Not at all. It will
be the easiest thing in life! My dear sir, a lawyer who
knows his business can, by a judicious application of ‘law,
testimony, and precedent,’ prove or disprove any thing that
he may be required to establish or to overthrow. In law,
‘those who bind can loose,’ those who loose can bind! I will
undertake to establish before the Court of Arches, the marriage
of Miss Morelle and Monsieur L’Orient to have been
perfectly legal, binding, and indissoluble, except by crime or
death!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! Dazzleright! Dazzleright!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course, having once successfully assailed and overthrown
that marriage before one court, I cannot consistently
support it before another! But I can find a lawyer
of talent and character, and can arm him with my argument,
so that he shall be able to do it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Dazzleright! Dazzleright!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My conscientious client, you never worked your way up
from the position of a provincial pettifogger’s clerk to that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>of a Baron of the Exchequer, or you would certainly have
learned something of the infinite possibilities of the law for
those who know how to avail themselves of its advantages.
The law is the most exact of all <em>sciences</em> in <em>theory</em>—the
most uncertain of all <em>arts</em> in <em>practice</em>. All depends upon
the application of its powers. In law, we can do or undo
just what we please,” said the best lawyer in England.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Dazzleright! Dazzleright! well named Dazzleright!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hist! here comes Johnson to lay the cloth for supper,”
said the Baron, as that functionary appeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor arose and paced up and down the floor,
saying to himself—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God, my sweet Estelle knows nothing of this
worldly wisdom, this doubling and twisting, this steering by
expediency! She has no hand in it, is not responsible for
it, is indeed totally ignorant of it. From first to last,
through all this veering and trimming of others, <em>she</em> has
held her pure, high, straightforward course, her path of
duty, of self-denial, self-immolation!” And by contrast
with these time-servers she seemed so true, so holy, and so
lovely, that his feeling for her, took the form of prayer, and
he stood in perfect silence before the window, until the
cheery voice of Lord Dazzleright summoned him to the
table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me one thing!” said Lord Montressor as he took
his seat at the board, “tell me for the satisfaction of my old
friendship for you,—how you could conscientiously seek to
overthrow Estelle’s first marriage, unless you believed it to
have been illegal?—and if you believe it to be so, how can
you possibly seek now to establish it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you—as you said, a lawyer’s opinion or a
Judge’s decision cannot in the slightest degree alter the
moral aspect of any case. Now the moral aspect of that
case, to me, was this:—that no sinner should be allowed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>take advantage of his own sin—that Monsieur Victoire
should not be permitted to carry off a woman of whom he
had so dishonestly possessed himself—if there was any law
to prevent him from doing so! And of course I knew that
there was plenty of law for that, as for most other purposes,
good or evil. And I determined to use the law. As for
the legal character of that marriage—there was so much to
be said on both sides, that really, had my own feelings been
disinterested, I should have found it difficult to have taken
up with zeal, <em>either</em> side; but my sympathies were strongly
enlisted, and I went to work with all my heart and soul to
save Estelle from the talons of the vulture Victoire. Now
that the bird of prey is dead—though neither the moral nor
the legal aspect of that fatal marriage is altered by that
circumstance, any more than it could be by the decision of
a court—yet my policy is changed—it is now expedient,
for the reasons heretofore stated, that I use the powers of
the law to establish the validity of the marriage, which it
was then expedient that I used the same powers to overthrow.
Then I was compelled to choose between two evils—now
I advocate a positive good.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God, Estelle is innocent of the knowledge of
your policy! I can bear this system of expediency in <em>you</em>.
I can even thank you for it, and admit that there is a sort
of worldly wisdom in it! Nay, more—I can accept your
congratulations upon my disappointment in failing to meet
Estelle! And I can rejoice in the knowledge of never
having passed one moment alone with her since our marriage
ceremony! For, indeed, scarcely to save my own
soul alive, would I bring upon her stricken young head one
shadow of reproach! I will await the action of the Arches
Court.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If that court pronounce her first, infantile marriage to
have been, as I was led to believe, illegal, it follows that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>second one was legal, and that Estelle is my lawful wife.
If, on the contrary, they adjudge it to have been valid—still
by the death of L’Orient, Estelle is free—I should woo
and wed her. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Except that in the latter case, Estelle would be freed
from the sign of blame!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is free from that in either case! She was innocent
of the intention of wrong doing!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly, but the world judges <em>acts</em>, not intentions.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor made a movement of impatience, and
then said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since L’Orient, at whose suit the action was brought
before the Arches Court is dead—at whose instance is that
suit now carried forward?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At her father’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At her father’s!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“At Sir Parke Morelle’s.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has returned to England?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And to his right mind, which is better still.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You amaze me! Is he reconciled to his unhappy
young daughter, then?” inquired Lord Montressor, in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Easy—easy—do not be in a hurry. You said that
Estelle was in Maryland, North America. Now, Sir Parke
has but just returned from Italy, and is spending his
Christmas at Hyde Hall, Devonshire. How is it possible
they should be now reconciled?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By an epistolary correspondence I should think it might
have been done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But it has not been done! Sir Parke does not even
know where she is, or any thing of her movements since the
trial, except that which we learned from yourself, namely,
that she embarked for America. He is exceeding anxious
for a meeting and a reconciliation with her. He is too
proud and fastidious to advertise even with caution and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>disguise; but he has dispatched a confidential agent to
America to seek her out.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘A needle in a haystack!’ Does he expect so to find
her on that vast continent?” exclaimed Lord Montressor,
impatiently, for he remembered that but for Sir Parke’s
unnatural severity and too late repentance, the poor,
“stricken deer” might now be safe in the covert of her
father’s house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! he hopes his agent will find her even on that
‘vast continent!’ Sir Parke, like most untraveled English
country gentlemen, looks upon the ‘vast continent’ of America
as a ‘vast’ wilderness, with only a few coast towns such
as Boston, New York, and the like, whose population might
be soon sifted by an intelligent ‘detective.’ That now, in
spite of geography and newspapers, is the cherished idea
of Sir Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Pshaw!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright laughed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor arose, and looked steadily into the eyes
of the advocate.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you suppose, Dazzleright, to be the cause of
Sir Parke Morelle’s change of feelings and purposes toward
his daughter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We might readily suppose Dame Nature to be the fundamental
cause. Surely, his present relenting is more
natural than his former severity toward her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Parke is not a man to be governed by his natural
affections.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps not <em>always</em>. But in this case, what is left him
but revision of his former sentence against Estelle? Has
he any other daughter?—has he any son?—has he even a
niece or nephew, or any other heir to his vast estate?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is true he has not; you put the point pertinently.
Yet, that circumstance alone would not sway his conduct!
The opinion of the world is the breath of his nostrils.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>“Eureka! you have found it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I am more confounded than ever! being at a
great loss to know how his love of the world should move
him in favor of her whom the world has forsaken.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There you are mistaken. Most people <em>are</em> confounded,
who reason from false premises. The world did not forsake
Estelle! Estelle forsook the world; you pursued her in
such hot haste, as not to have first discovered this fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you tell me!” exclaimed Lord Montressor, in
a sort of glad surprise and incredulity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That there is not a woman in England more beloved
and respected by those from whom love and respect are
most valuable, than our Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dazzleright! this cannot be so! The world is not so
just to the unfortunate.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The world, like the devil, is not half so black as it is
painted. ‘Listen! reaction is commensurate with action.’
It was inevitable, at first, when the suddenness and enormity
of the charge brought against Estelle had shocked her
friends and acquaintances from their propriety, that she
should have been regarded with abhorrence. But when
that panic was past; when people had time to become composed
and thoughtful; and, above all, when the simple
<span class='fss'>FACTS</span> developed and proved upon the trial had replaced
the exaggerated <em>fictions</em> of gossip; and when it was understood
that Estelle had, from the moment of her arrest at the
altar, reserved herself from the presence of Lord Montressor,
and had, as soon as possible, withdrawn herself from
his knowledge, there was a mighty reaction in her favor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God! Oh, thank God for that! Thank God
that the public were able to know Estelle and to do her justice!”
exclaimed Lord Montressor, who, though in heart
might despise the fluctuations of popular opinion for himself,
yet dreaded it for Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God for all things, and the world for nothing,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>replied Dazzleright; “Estelle’s whole life of goodness was
not to be abrogated by one storm of calumny! That was
a crisis in which the power of her own personal righteousness
saved her. Your own name, character, reputation and
popularity also served her well!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Whatever of good repute, or ‘golden opinions’ I possessed
were at her service—were under her feet, if that would
have saved them from the burning plow-shares!” said
Lord Montressor, fervently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unscorched she passed those fiery plow-shares. Her
trial over, people judged her, in some sort, as you and I
judge her. Her beautiful Christian life, the facts elicited
on her trial, her subsequent self-sacrifice, all tended to draw
back to her esteem and affection. All whose good opinion
is worth having, love and revere her. Even the envious and
malignant dare not traduce her, lest their motive become too
apparent. And now I say, as I said in the beginning, there
is not a woman in England more sincerely esteemed than
Estelle. Sir Parke Morelle, restored in some degree to
his reason, came back to find this state of feeling prevailing.
It affected, it influenced, it governed him. He resolved to
seek and call home his wandering child. If his resolution
needed confirming, it received confirmation. Estelle’s misfortunes
had moved sympathy in the highest quarters—Sir
Parke, and Lady Morelle attended the first drawing-room
of the season. It was unusually brilliant, and so crowded
that Royalty could vouchsafe but a word or two to each
passing aspirant for notice. Lady Morelle’s turn came;
judge the effect when Queen Adelaide—her goodness is
proverbial—inquired graciously after the health of Lady
Morelle’s daughter, expressing regret at not seeing her
present! This was done for a purpose, and it effected its
object. Ladies of the most ancient peerages—of a nobility
indubitable and redoubtable, who can do as they please,
because it is impossible for them to do wrong—followed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>now the royal lead. The more timid, though not less
well-disposed, brought up the rear. You understand this
was not done all at once at the drawing-room—though
thence the fiat issued—thence the impetus was given. Even
the most cowardly were not afraid to venture where Royalty
had gone before!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But Sir Parke! Lady Morelle! what reply could <em>they</em>
make, good Heaven! when asked for their hapless daughter?
Some such answer I suppose as Cain gave when asked for
his brother!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humph! they just replied that she was in America, and
they had sent out a confidential agent there to seek her.
Eh bien! you comprehend that the ordeal is well past!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank God!” fervently ejaculated Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Amen—and long live Queen Adelaide!” replied Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor looked around.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you want?” inquired Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My hat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are not going?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! here are some famous cigars—stop and try
them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Cannot. I am down into Devonshire by the midnight
train! Good-bye!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you are not going, certainly?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Absolutely and instantaneously. I shall not even first
return to my hotel, as it is now eleven o’clock, and the
Western train starts at twelve. So I will tax your kindness
to send one of your men to Gerard’s, to direct my
people there to follow me by the next train, if you will do
me the favor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly; but you have not said to what point in the
great county of Devon I shall direct the fellows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You surely know! I am off to see Sir Parke Morelle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>at Hyde Hall. Tell them to put up at the ‘Morelle Arms,
Hyde.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Humph! Do you know that I was due there to eat a
Christmas dinner to-morrow? So it may ensue that I shall
follow you to assist at that grand pow-wow that must come
off to-morrow evening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall be very well satisfied if you do! Shall I say to
Sir Parke that you will come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If you please?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye, then,” said Lord Montressor, extending his
hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bon voyage!” replied the other, pressing the proffered
member.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so the companions parted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor re-entered the cab that had, during his
visit, waited at the door, and gave the order:</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Western Railway Depot.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The cabman drove on, and in due season reached this
place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor entered the cars, which were on the eve
of starting, and soon found himself whirled onward toward
the Western Grand Junction, which near daybreak he
reached.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here he left the cars for the mail-coach that daily passed
the village, which was the point of his destination.</p>

      <div class='line'>“The misletoe hung in the castle hall,</div>
      <div class='line'>The holly-branch shone on the old oak wall,</div>
      <div class='line'>The baron’s retainers were blithe and gay,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The sun was rising when the mail-coach arrived at the
little hamlet of Hyde, and drew up before the “Morelle
Arms.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Bright and gay with misletoe and holly was the little inn.</p>

<p class='c013'>Busy and cheerful was the buxom little landlady. Bustling
she hurried out to welcome any chance guests that the mail
might have brought her. Evidently she expected some one—probably
Lord Dazzleright, for Hyde Hall, so anxious and
scrutinizing were the glances she sent into the interior of
the coach. Her honest countenance beamed with joy at
seeing Lord Montressor alight. Yet still she looked for
some one to come after him.</p>

<p class='c013'>No one followed. The stage-coach drove on.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little landlady courtesied.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Welcome back to Devonshire, my lord! Walk in, my
lord! This way, my lord! Would your lordship choose
breakfast?” she inquired, with busy, respectful solicitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yes, his lordship would take breakfast, and afterward a
post-chase to Hyde Hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little landlady bustled out to obey his orders; and then
bustled back again to lay the cloth for breakfast. Her
cheerful face was now disturbed by anxiety. She cast furtive
searching glances into Lord Montressor’s thoughtful,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>abstracted countenance—and quickly withdrew them in fear
of discovery. In fact, the little body would have given the
world, or at least her share in it—“Morelle Arms”—to have
the privilege of inquiring after her nursling, Estelle. On
observing Lord Montressor alight from the coach, she had
naturally looked to see him hand <em>her</em> out, thinking that they
were both together, and both going to spend Christmas
with the lady’s parents up at the Hall. She could not understand
why “my lord” should be <em>en route</em> alone, to enjoy
Christmas with her family, where she was not. It is true
that many contradictory rumors had reached Hyde. But
Dame Higgins doubted each and all, and now seeing Lord
Montressor, she sighed for Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the breakfast was ready she brought it in, and with
the hope of hearing something indirectly of her “nurse
child,” she remained and waited on the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you know, are the family at the Hall in their usual
health, Mrs. Higgins?” inquired his lordship, as he received
a cup of coffee from her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, my lord, begging your lordship’s pardon, is it like
they should be well? Sir Parke is much broken, and Lady
Morelle is not the handsome, youthful-looking woman that
she was a year ago,” said the landlady, shaking her head
gravely.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now Lord Montressor had not asked for, or expected
this implied reflection upon the family misfortunes, on the
part of Mother Higgins. He surmised in himself, a certain
indiscretion in having made any inquiries whatever. He
now made no comment upon her communication, but continued
perfectly silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not so the landlady. As his lordship had set the example
of asking questions, she ventured to follow it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope my lady was in good health when your lordship
came away?” said Mrs. Higgins, putting her question in
the most polite—that is, in the affirmative, form.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>“I thank you—yes,” replied Lord Montressor, in a tone
and manner that forbade farther encroachments on the part
of his hostess.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little woman therefore occupied herself with waiting
on her guest, and held her tongue until again she was
spoken with.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can I have a chaise from this place to take me over to
the Hall, Mrs. Higgins?” at length asked Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, your lordship, I am very sorry, but the chaise
has gone to Horsford, this morning, to take over some
Christmas visitors that came down from London last night,
and it won’t be back before noon,” replied the landlady,
with a look of real regret.</p>

<p class='c013'>Horsford! How that name recalled the scene of the
preliminary investigation. “Ah, Sir George Bannerman,
that is a debt that remains to be settled,” thought Lord
Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Observing his lordship’s deepened gravity, and attributing
it to his disappointment in regard to the chaise, the
hostess hastened to add—</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, my lord, Jenkins has not yet gone home.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Jenkins?—who may he be?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lord, Jenkins—Sir Parke Morelle’s man, who
was sent here from the Hall this morning with the carriage
to meet Lord Dazzleright, who didn’t arrive.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And Jenkins, you say, has not gone back with the carriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, my lord; he is in the kitchen at this present moment,
having a rasher and a pot of ale.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well. When Jenkins has finished his repast, be
good enough to send him here,” said Lord Montressor,
rising from the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, my lord,” she replied, going out to obey.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>In a few minutes, the coachman from Hyde Hall entered
the presence of his lordship.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here again was a recognition full of painful reminiscences!
Jenkins was the gray-haired old man who had driven
the carriage containing the bridal party, from the Hall to
the church, on that fatal first of May. Lord Montressor
had not seen him since that dark day.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man stood respectfully, hat in hand, waiting his
lordship’s commands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you do, Jenkins? I hope the family at the
Hall are well?” were Lord Montressor’s first words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hem—m—m, as well as usual, I believe, my lord,” replied
the aged domestic, hesitatingly, though respectfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor then announced that he had come down
to visit Sir Parke Morelle, and would be pleased to have a
seat in the homeward-bound carriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>The horses were feeding; but Jenkins would have them
put to the carriage immediately; and bowing low, he went
out to attend to the matter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor then called for a room, paid such attention
to his toilet as the circumstances admitted, then
went below, settled his reckoning, and entered the carriage
that waited to take him to Hyde Hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was a fine, clear, bright winter morning. A light
snow, that had fallen during the night, just covered the
ground, and added to the cheerfulness of the scene. A
slight frost, like the embroidering of fine pearls, just
touched the trees.</p>

<p class='c013'>The little village was already gay with Christmas revelings.
Misletoe and holly decked many of the doors and
windows of the houses each side of the only street, at the
head of which stood the “Morelle Arms,” and down which
the carriage now drove. Neighbors hailed each other;
children in troops ran gayly, with “Merry Christmas,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>from dwelling to dwelling, or came out thence, with hands,
hats, or pinafores, full of “goodies.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The carriage leaving the gay village street behind,
passed on down the turnpike road leading through the
common toward the park.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just before turning in the great gate, they passed the
little Gothic church, the scene of Estelle’s fatal bridal and
subsequent arrest. This was the most painful of all the
reminiscences awakened by his return to the neighborhood.
The little church was open, and was dressed within and
without with mistletoe and holly. And some of the most
devout among the parishioners had assembled thus early
to assist at Divine worship, and were now walking about
and conversing cheerfully in the church-yard, while waiting
for the hour of service to arrive. Several of the old men
took off their hats to his lordship, as the carriage passed.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Lord Montressor could ill bear this scene with the
graphic pictures of the past that it recalled. So bowing
gently to their salutations, he quietly put up the blinds of
the carriage, gave orders to drive faster, and then sunk
back into his seat until they had entered the park.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Having passed the park gates, the whole scene was
changed. No sign of Christmas festivity was here. No
winter wreath of mingled misletoe and holly arched the
entrance. No gay troops of village children carolled their
Christmas song as they went up to the Hall to receive
from the steward their Christmas gifts of cakes and shillings.
All was quiet, sombre, gloomy, as though a recent
death in the family had put the household and premises
into mourning. The carriage entered the park by
the “winter drive,” an avenue shaded entirely by gigantic
evergreens, and for its continued verdure and close shelter
used exclusively in the cold months by this comfort-loving
family. Now these dark trees, with their branches meeting
overhead, threw a funereal shadow over their way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As they neared the Hall, the gloom deepened. The
dark gray front of the mansion was closed and silent. The
carriage drew up in front of the great portal. The coachman
got down, opened the carriage door, dropped the
steps, and Lord Montressor alighted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man then went up and rang the bell, and to the
grave footman that opened the door, said:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>“John, show his lordship into the black oak parlor, and
take his orders.”</p>

<p class='c013'>John bowed, and as the old coachman withdrew, closed the
door behind him, turned and with another bow led the way
to a small, snug, but gloomy little sitting-room on the same
floor, stirred the fire, drew forward an easy chair, and leaving
him comfortably seated, went to take up the card.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few moments, John returned with the request that
the visitor would walk up, and straightway preceded him to
the door of the morning room, which he opened, announcing—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke and Lady Morelle were seated at opposite
corners of the ample fire-place, in the grate of which burned
a fine fire of seacoal.</p>

<p class='c013'>Both were greatly and sadly changed. Worldliness might
indeed have chilled their parental affections, and pride might
have repressed all utterance of grief or mortification. But
that they had suffered deeply, keenly, bitterly, was indelibly
impressed upon their faces.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke had grown bald and gray; his features were
visibly sunken, his form perceptibly shrunken.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Morelle’s fair, classic face had lost its firm oval
contour and delicate bloom, and was marked with a light
tracery of lines about the brow and eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>But both retained their cold and stately self-control.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Lord Montressor advanced, Sir Parke arose and offered
him his hand, saying merely—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad to see you, Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank you, Sir Parke; that is but just, since I come
to you within twenty-four hours of my landing in England,”
replied the visitor, smiling. Then he passed on to Lady
Morelle, who arose coldly and offered her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I hope I find your ladyship in your usual good health,
this morning?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>“I am well, sir, and am happy to welcome you back to
England,” she replied, sinking again upon her sofa to the
left of the chimney. Sir Parke resumed his seat on the
right of the same. And Lord Montressor took the comfortable
easy chair that had been drawn up for him by the
footman, in front of the glowing fire. And there he sat
with the haughty and reserved baronet, on his right, and
the cold and stately lady on his left,—all silent for a few
minutes until Sir Parke bethought him to dismiss the footman.</p>

<p class='c013'>When they were alone, Lord Montressor turned to the
baronet, and plunging directly into the subject of all their
secret thoughts, said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Parke, it has given me the profoundest satisfaction
to learn from Lord Dazzleright that you have relented toward
your daughter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The baronet’s countenance never changed. He passed
his hand once or twice across his thin and sunken lips and
then said, slowly and composedly:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That trial, sir, however deplorable and ever-to-be regretted
in itself, nevertheless elicited facts that proved Estelle
to be much less blameworthy than she at first appeared.
Yes, sir. Such is the judgment of those who rule, and who
should rule, public opinion.”</p>

<p class='c013'>To this sentiment Lord Montressor merely bowed while
waiting to hear further.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Estelle, sir, was but an infant, in bad hands, when she
committed that fatal act of disobedience.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor could not exactly understand how Estelle
had disobeyed her parents, in marrying Victoire, whom
she had never been forbidden to marry; but he let it pass.
Sir Parke continued in the same slow and composed manner—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The calamities growing out of that unhappy event are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>not to be attributed as crimes to her—the greatest sufferer
by them.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad you see it in this light, Sir Parke,” said Lord
Montressor, at the same time thinking within himself that
it was a signal pity he could not have seen it so before borrowing
old Queen Adelaide’s spectacles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have determined to establish the first marriage,”
said the baronet, with the cool confidence of an autocrat.
“I have talked with my friend, the Archbishop of York,
and he thinks with me that it is the only thing to be done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But—you are sure of your ground—you are certain
that it can be done?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke put down the hand that had been caressing his
own chin, turned upon the caviller a look of cool surprise,
and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly, sir. Can there be a question of it? The only
obstacle to the validity of that childish union was the lack
of my consent. Now I intend to leave it to be supposed
that my silence all these years, was the silence of consent.
Yes, sir. Had I known of, and felt an opposition to that
marriage, I might have broken it up at first. That I failed
to do so—from whatever cause—argues my consent. That
I allowed it to exist unquestioned, up to the date of the
legal majority of my daughter, establishes the marriage.
So my friend, the Archbishop, views it. The affair will be
heard in chambers. The Court is friendly to my interests.
The decision will involve no question of property or of
dower, only the honor of my house, which must be redeemed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When will the case come on?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very soon. It will be the first cause taken up.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You have not lately heard from your daughter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not since her departure for America. I, however, dispatched
a messenger after her, from whom I am expecting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>to hear by every mail,” replied Sir Parke, slightly betraying
the great uneasiness he felt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I bring you the latest news of Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Now both Sir Parke and Lady Morelle had expected
this; but were both too cool and self-governed to hazard
an inquiry, or manifest anxiety upon the subject.</p>

<p class='c013'>At Lord Montressor’s words, however, Lady Morelle
raised her head, and Sir Parke answered:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, indeed; then I hope, my lord, that you will tell
me she is well, and within reach of my agent.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She was well when I left, and living in retirement, in
Maryland.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke bowed, and compressed his lips. Lady Morelle
flushed, and averted her face. Self-controlled as they were,
their increasing anxiety betrayed itself.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor understood its full meaning, and, with
his usual straightforward candor, replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fear nothing, Sir Parke. Although when I left the
shores of England in pursuit of Estelle, I believed her to
be my lawful bride; yet, since affairs have taken this unexpected
turn, I thank Heaven that I have not seen her from
the day she left the protection of her aged pastor, and,
moreover, that I had not passed one moment alone with
her since leaving the altar.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is well,” answered Sir Parke, coolly, and in no
degree revealing that a great burden of anxiety had been
lifted from his mind.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lady Morelle’s countenance resumed its slightly discomposed
serenity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But it is only fair to inform the parents of Estelle, that
when the decision of the Arches’ Court is rendered, I shall
become a candidate for her hand. Until that time, I am
forbidden, of all, to seek her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke bent his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are right, my lord,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>Lady Morelle now, also, for the first time, entered into
the conversation, by saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You informed us that Estelle was living in retirement,
in some part of Maryland. Will you please to designate
more exactly the place of her residence?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot do so, Madam, since I am not advised of it.
Had I been so, it is probable that I should not now be sitting
among you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your information, then, is not very precise or satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is satisfactory, so far as it goes, Madam; though I
admit it is not very precise. Permit me to explain;”—and
Lord Montressor here related the circumstances of his acquaintance
with Barbara Brande, together with the conversations
he had held with her upon the subject of Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But is this reliable? Is not Estelle the last woman in
the world, even in her extremity, to make a confidante of
such a she-savage?” inquired Sir Parke.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have I, then, been so unjust or incompetent as to give
you <em>that</em> idea of Miss Brande?—a heroic Christian woman,
if ever I saw one!” exclaimed Lord Montressor, warmly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A female sailor, at best. But let that pass, Montressor,
since you are her apologist. Here comes John from the
steward’s room.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The footman now indeed appeared and announced—</p>

<p class='c013'>“The tenants are all arrived, Sir Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well!” said the baronet, rising with a dissatisfied air—“I
suppose we must show ourselves to them—I suppose
they came pouring in hither from the church, eh, John?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Church is just out, sir, and they have just dropped in
to Mr. Thompson’s room, to wish your honor a merry
Christmas.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And to drink a pipe of wine!—very good! Lady Morelle,
will you go with me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, no, Sir Parke,” said her ladyship, shrugging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>her graceful shoulders at the thought of meeting the
heterogeneous company below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you, Montressor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will attend you with pleasure, Sir Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, then! It is an old custom, to treat our tenants
on Christmas day; and though I would have well dispensed
with their company upon this occasion, and though nothing
was said about their coming, you see they have not forgotten
it,” said the baronet, as they left the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A time-honored custom, worthy to be observed, Sir
Parke! and I hope indeed that my bailiff at Montressor is
not forgetting my children there, at this present time,” replied
the young peer, who was indeed the patriarch of his
own tenants and dependants.</p>

<p class='c013'>“By the way, can you tell me why Dazzleright has not
made his appearance?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He will be down by the noon train, Sir Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, indeed, if that is so—John!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” said that functionary coming up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell Jenkins to put the greys to the carriage and go to
the ‘Arms’ to wait for Lord Dazzleright.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir!” and this official disappeared.</p>

<p class='c013'>They went down another flight of steps and entered the
steward’s room, where about fifty or sixty persons, men,
women and children, were assembled.</p>

<p class='c013'>The men were all standing for the want of sufficiency of
seats to accommodate their numbers; and the women all
sitting, with the children gathered at each mother’s knee,
to be kept out of mischief.</p>

<p class='c013'>Four moderate-sized tables were set out and laden with
huge loaves of bread and rounds of beef, great cheeses and
mammoth seed-cakes—all veritable pieces of resistance.</p>

<p class='c013'>In one corner, under the direction of the butler, stood two
grinning footmen, surrounded by several hampers of wine,
and flanked by a stand laden with glasses. One of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>worthies was engaged in drawing corks, while the other
filled the goblets on the stand.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the opposite end of the room, with his firm feet
planted upon the rug, and his broad, responsible back toward
the fire, stood Mr. Thompson, the steward, to impose
decorum by his magisterial presence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon the entrance of the Lord of the Manor and his distinguished
guest, this “decorum” grew more decorous—took
a higher degree. The flunkies at the hampers stopped
grinning. The men all bowed. The women all arose and
courtesied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke received their homage graciously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am happy to see you here as usual, my friends. Sit
down all of you who can find seats; but you will give the
women the preference, I know——Thompson, see that our
good friends lack nothing. Brodie, mind that you do not
spare the cellars,” said the baronet.</p>

<p class='c013'>A few of the elder and more privileged among the tenants
now advanced, bowed to the guest, and shook hands with
their landlord, wishing both—</p>

<p class='c013'>“A merry Christmas and many happy returns of the
same.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The first course of wine was then served around. And a
grey-haired tenant arose in his place and proposed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our honored landlord, his family, and his guests—may
everlasting happiness be theirs!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The toast was heartily taken up and drank with enthusiasm—for
just at Christmas Sir Parke Morelle and his
lady were well liked by their dependants—or if they were
not, their Christmas cheer <em>was</em>, which answered the same
purpose.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the uproar of the toast-drinking had subsided, the
baronet and his visitor, wishing the assembled people health
and prosperity, withdrew, leaving them to their repast.</p>

<p class='c006'>The gentlemen then went to the drawing-room, whither
Lady Morelle, in full dinner dress, had already preceded
them. And here Lord Montressor learned that other
guests were then staying at the house—a fact that he
never could have supposed from the gloomy aspect of the
place. However they were soon joined by her grace, the
old Duchess of Graveminster, with her grand-daughters,
the ladies Jane and Mary Chappelle, and oh! “tell it not
in Gath! publish it not in the gates of Askelon!”—by
Lord and Lady Monson, Mr. and Mrs. Howard Kennaugh,
and Mrs. Bute Trevor!—ladies who, in Lady Bannerman’s
boudoir, had been the most unsparing in their denunciation
of the beautiful Estelle, the only daughter of that
house, whose hospitality they now sought! Does the
reader wonder at this? No, he does not! He or she
knows this double dealing to be the way of too many people
in this world of ours, and will not therefore wonder
even when I affirm that these were almost self-invited
guests, a party made up to please themselves, and through
the medium of the Duchess of Graveminster, all but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>forced upon the hospitalities of Hyde Hall. For in truth,
neither the baronet nor his lady were in the slightest
degree disposed to entertain a Christmas party at their
sorrowful house.</p>

<p class='c013'>Late in the afternoon Lord Montressor’s valet came in a
post-chaise from the “Morelle Arms,” with his master’s
portmanteau and dressing-case—conveniences that were
growing imminently necessary; for in truth his lordship’s
toilet, by reason of his hasty journey, was in a very unlordly
plight.</p>

<p class='c013'>A little latter in the evening Lord Dazzleright arrived
by the carriage that had been sent for him, and just in
time to dress for dinner.</p>

<p class='c013'>That Christmas feast was served by candle-light at six
o’clock.</p>

<p class='c013'>A distinguished company gathered around the board,
but something was felt to be wanting! Where was she,
the heiress of that house, the father’s pride, who should
have been the “star of that goodlie companie”? Missing,
gone, lost! And though many splendid chandeliers flashed
down their rainbow radiance over the festive scene, they
would not compensate for that light withdrawn. All felt
the gloom and shadow of her absence. And very dull
would have been this dinner party, but for the presence of
the brilliant conversationist, Baron Dazzleright. Sir Parke
Morelle understood his value upon these occasions, and
therefore, when in a manner compelled to invite this
Christmas party to his gloomy house, had, for this reason,
among others, pressed Lord Dazzleright to come down to
Hyde. Witty, sparkling, sarcastic, caustic, he was the
right sort of biting acid to throw into the alkali of this flat
set, to sting them into life and effervescence. And he did
it. The conversation prospered—the jest, the jibe, the
repartee, and the laugh went around. When the ladies
had retired from the table, the festivity turned to revelry,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>and laughter, song and toast went around for an hour
longer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, in good time, they joined Lady Morelle and her
companions in the drawing-room, where coffee was served.
And there still was Lord Dazzleright “the life of the company.”
He was but thirty-five years old, handsome,
talented, witty, distinguished, wealthy, titled, and—unmarried!
consequently he was the worshiped of all young
widows, virgins, and maneuvering mammas. In the first
part of the evening he distributed his services very equally
among the ladies present; but, in the latter part, divided
his attentions between the two ladies Chappelle; and, last
of all, confined his devotions to the pretty widow, Mrs.
Bute Trevor.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the hour for retiring had arrived, Lord Dazzleright
bowed out every guest before he bid Sir Parke and
Lady Morelle good-night. And after these Herculean
labors, these unheard-of exertions, he bowed <em>himself</em> out,
and, with a weary air, followed up stairs the footman who
was appointed to show him his sleeping-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is Lord Montressor’s chamber?” he inquired of
this functionary, as soon as he had dragged himself up
one flight of stairs, and paused in the hall of the second
floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There, sir, just opposite your own,” replied John.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go, then, you needn’t wait.”</p>

<p class='c013'>John touched his forelock and retired.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let me in! Let me in!” exclaimed the lion of the
evening, roaring rather peremptorily at the door of Lord
Montressor’s apartment.</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship himself opened the door, and appeared
with a look of surprise on his face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What! has your fellow gone to bed, Montressor?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has not come up from the servants’ hall yet. But
what upon earth ails you?—fatigued with your exertions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>or borne down under the weight of your laurels—which?
You look, at once, as weary and as triumphant as ‘a warrior
who putteth off his armor.’ What is it?” inquired Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Dazzleright threw himself into a chair, exclaiming—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! these women! these women!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What women?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“These fine ladies! It is a weariness of the soul to try
to entertain them for one evening!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! and now I look at you more closely, it is not
triumphant but desperate that you look.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am just a little excited! and if some of these are not
taken away to-morrow morning, I shall elope!—that is all!”
exclaimed Dazzleright, drawing out his pocket-handkerchief,
and wiping his heated brow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With whom?” coolly inquired Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Montressor, don’t aggravate my symptoms! I am in a
considerable state of nervous excitement.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The truth is, that you suffer from what the French
wittily call the ‘embarrassment of riches.’ You do not
know how to choose between the fair Lady Jane or Mary
Chappelle, and the pretty Mrs. Bute Trevor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are my pistols? If I had them at hand I might
do something indiscreet—the ladies Chappel and Mrs. Bute
Trevor! two inane, characterless girls, and a flat, spiritless
widow! I had as leave wed one of Madame Tousaud’s wax
images as either.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are severe; they are what are called ‘harmoniously
developed women,’” answered Lord Montressor, with the
least possible of quiet humor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, in the name of all life, give me monsters!” broke
forth Dazzleright, with energy. “Bah—bah—bah—bah—they
are as like each other, and as like all their class, as
peas in a pod. I beg the peas pardon—peas have life——these
women are as uniform, as dull, as dead, and as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>heavy as leaden bullets from the same mould; with no more
originality, individuality, life, power than the leaden balls
aforesaid! By my soul, they are so uniform, that each
should be ticketed with her name, that we may know her
from her fellows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Chut! you have received a flat from Lady Jane or
Mary Chappelle,” laughed Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>I</em> received a flat! No! and I never shall from any fine
lady. I have been trying to entertain a score of flats,
that’s it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will marry Mrs. Bute Trevor, yet,” persisted Lord
Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I’ll marry an Indian squaw. Civilized women are degenerated—besides,
being so much alike that I can’t tell
one from another!” exclaimed Dazzleright, bouncing out
of the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day was the Sabbath, and the family and their
visitors attended Divine service at the little Gothic chapel
outside the park gate.</p>

<p class='c013'>On Monday Lord Dazzleright put his threat in execution
and rather than spend another evening in the arduous and
unprofitable labor of trying to leaven lead, took leave of his
friends and departed, telling no one the fact that imperative
business called him back to town.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the second of January, the Christmas party broke up,
and the guests left the sombre shades of Hyde Hall, to seek
more cheerful scenes.</p>

<p class='c013'>On the evening of the same date, Lord Montressor, accompanied
by Sir Parke Morelle, took the up train to London,
where they arrived the next morning at daybreak, and
proceeded immediately by appointment, to the house of
Lord Dazzleright, on Berkley Square.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was time they had come. The Arches Court was sitting,
and the question of the L’Orient marriage was before
it. Sir Parke Morelle used all his powerful connection and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>social influence, and Lord Dazzleright devoted his great
regal abilities to bring about the desired decision. And after
a session of ten days—shall we also say, after a deliberate,
careful, and impartial investigation?—that decision was
rendered.</p>

<p class='c013'>That decision established the validity of the marriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright laughed aloud when he heard it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke Morelle received the news with the composure
of a man who was prepared to expect nothing else.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Lord Montressor turned pale, he was thinking how
perilously uncertain are the dearest interests in life, when
their permanency may be shown to depend upon the merest
legal quibbles! he was remembering how nearly, in his
blind devotion, he had fatally compromised Estelle; he was
thanking Heaven that her pure instinct had been a safer
guide than all his power of intellect.</p>

<p class='c013'>The three gentlemen consulted upon the question of what
should be their next step. All agreed that it was better
they should wait no longer to hear from the agent who had
been dispatched to America in quest of Estelle; but that
Lord Montressor should get all the information he could
possibly obtain from Barbara Brande; after which his lordship
should accompany Sir Parke Morelle on a voyage to
the United States in search of the missing one.</p>

<p class='c013'>This plan having been determined upon, Sir Parke
hurried down into Devonshire, to have his wardrobe packed
up, his purse replenished, and to bid adieu to his lady;
meanwhile leaving Lord Montressor in London to wait for
Barbara Brande, whose vessel had crossed the Channel, but
was daily expected back.</p>

<p class='c013'>Almost every day Lord Montressor went down to St.
Catherine’s Docks to inquire for the Petrel. At length his
perseverance was rewarded.</p>

<p class='c013'>One day he went down to the dock, accompanied by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>Lord Dazzleright, and was so fortunate as to spy the Petrel,
anchored some distance down the river.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hailing a waterman, he hired his boat to take himself
and friend to that vessel. They entered the boat, and in a
very few minutes were rowed out and brought up alongside
the little craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Petrel, as usual, was in the nicest possible trim.
Her snow-white sails were neatly clewed up; her clean
ropes were carefully coiled away; her deck was newly
scrubbed; her painted doors and ports freshly washed, and
very bright; and every scrap of metal about her body
shining like gold and silver. A Sabbath stillness reigned
aboard. Two boys, neatly dressed in sailor’s costume, had
charge of the deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>As Lord Montressor and his friend came up the starboard
gangway, the elder of these boys walked forward and took
off his hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! this is my friend, Willful Brande,” said Lord
Montressor, taking his hand, cordially shaking it, and then
presenting him to Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is your sister, my lad?” inquired Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone up to Manchester to see if she can make a better
bargain for cotton goods with the manufacturer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed! Why, when did she go?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yesterday morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Really? Why, I thought that you were just in?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; we cast anchor yesterday at sunrise. Sister
left for Manchester at about eleven o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when do you expect her home?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Every moment. She promised to be back to-day by
the midday train, and sister never disappoints us. It is
now past noon, and we may look for her every minute.
There she is now! I said so!” exclaimed the boy, in sudden
joy, pointing to a boat well laden, and having besides
<span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>one female passenger, and which was just pushing off from
the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>They followed the direction of his finger, and recognized
Barbara seated among many bales of what seemed dry
goods.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who takes care of the craft while your sister is away?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do—but Nep and Jack do any heavy work that is
needed; and Climene, sister’s woman-servant, cooks for
us. And then sister never leaves us for more than one
day at a time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor now went to speak to the younger
lad, who was sitting under the shade of the foresail,
reading.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What are you studying, my lad?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is,” said the boy, turning to the back of the book
to give the title more accurately, “‘The Manners and
Customs of Different Nations,’ a book that Mrs. Estel’s
woman made me a present of.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Estel!” exclaimed Lord Montressor, exchanging
glances with Dazzleright, who had just come up to his side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir, Mrs. Estel—the lady who leased the Headland
from sister.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A sudden light broke on both gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fool that I was, not to have guessed before that the
recluse lady who was Miss Brande’s tenant, could have
been none other than our lost Estelle!” said Lord Montressor
to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>He took Dazzleright’s arm and walked aft.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There will now be no necessity to urge Miss Brande to
a revelation that she might consider a breach of faith, and
refuse to make. Providence has put us in possession of the
retreat of Estelle. We will therefore make no further inquiries
upon that subject; but engage passage to Baltimore
more, and when we get opposite to the Headland, go on
shore to seek Estelle in the old house.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>“Yes, that is a good plan——Look at that fine
creature!” exclaimed Lord Dazzleright, suddenly breaking
off and pointing to a young woman in a gray serge dress,
who was just coming up the starboard gangway.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Barbara Brande, who was looking in high health
and beauty. No adventitious arts of the toilet lent their
aid to this brave and gentle daughter of the ocean—a gown,
a large sacque and hood, all of dark gray, comprised her
outside garments. But the hood was rolled back, revealing
the handsome, spirited face, with its bands of shining, jet-black hair, parted and rippling in waves down each side of
her broad forehead and damask cheeks, and the strong,
flashing black eyes, that at a glance seemed to take in the
whole deck with every detail thereon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Willful! call the hands up to haul in freight,” were her
first words of command, delivered in her own clear, ringing,
resonant voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>As the boy sprang to obey, Barbara walked aft to receive
her visitors.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You perceive that I render myself according to promise,
Miss Brande,” said Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am happy to see you again, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is my friend, Lord Dazzleright,” said Lord Montressor,
presenting his companion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you do, sir?” said Barbara, then breaking off
suddenly, before Dazzleright could get off his handsomely-turned
reply, she called out—“Boys, look alive there!
You will not get the freight in to-day at this rate! Willful!
take the little boat and go ashore to hurry those watermen
with those other bales. Paul, bear a hand there!
Now, gentlemen, I am at your service! What can I do for
you?” she inquired, turning to her visitors to give them her
full attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Lord Dazzleright felt piqued and turned away. Evidently
the handsome creature, the child of the sea, cared no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>more for this Baron of the Exchequer, this brilliant conversationist,
this lion of the London salons—in a word, for
this Lord Dazzleright, than she did for any other honest
man! Here was an unsophisticated savage. What did the
young woman mean? he asked himself. Had she eyes?
Had she sense?</p>

<p class='c013'>While Lord Dazzleright sulked at being unconsciously
snubbed by the handsome Amazon, Lord Montressor
opened his business. First he told her that the Court of
Arches had established the L’Orient marriage.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara bowed—she had expected as much.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Consequently,” he went on to say, “Sir Parke and myself
go to America to find Estelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is right,” Barbara answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can Miss Brande give us a passage to Baltimore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you also give the address of Estelle?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, as that would be a breach of confidence; but I
will go to the lady and entreat her permission to inform
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor smiled, and said that would do.</p>

<p class='c013'>The arrangements for the passage of Sir Parke Morelle,
of himself, and a single servant for each, were forthwith
completed.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, as the boats with the freight, under charge of
Willful, had arrived, and Miss Brande was thronged with
business, the two gentlemen took their leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you think of that young merchant captain,”
inquired Lord Montressor, as they were rowed from the side
of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Barbara?—well named! A young Barbarian she is!”
exclaimed Lord Dazzleright, angrily.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor smiled.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The next morning, Sir Parke Morelle, with his favorite
servant and his baggage, made up for a long sea voyage,
arrived from Devonshire. When informed that passage for
the party had been engaged on Miss Brande’s vessel, the
Petrel, he at first demurred at the idea of risking their lives
in a craft commanded by a woman. But in the course of
half an hour’s conversation, Lord Montressor convinced
him that the inevitable dangers of a sea voyage could in no
way be enhanced to them through their sailing with Barbara
Brande, who was, in all respects, admirably well adapted
to her chosen position.</p>

<p class='c013'>His lordship then imparted to the Baronet the fact of
their accidental discovery of Estelle’s place of abode, and
also of their fixed resolution to keep that discovery a secret
until they should arrive at the Headland—a plan that the
baronet heartily approved.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright rendered himself very officious and
busy! Never was so zealous and serviceable a friend. He
insisted that Sir Parke and Montressor had quite enough
business to occupy them on shore, and that he himself
should see to the embarkation of their baggage. But Lord
Dazzleright, assuredly, proved himself incompetent, or else
willfully negligent of his self-assumed duties; for the manner
in which he contrived to spread the business of one day over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>an entire week, was highly exasperating to the prompt and
energetic Barbara. For instance, one day he would see a
trunk safely on board, and, having done so, would remain
on deck by the hour, watching that handsome, falcon-eyed,
commanding young Amazon, who had no time to talk to
him; who took no notice of him; in short, who cared no
more for <em>him</em>—Lord Dazzleright—than she did for the old
waterman that had brought him to the vessel, or for any
other decent poor man. This sort of indifference was
something new to the lion of the London salons! It was
novel, piquant, provoking, incomprehensible. He mentally
termed her a barbarian, without capacity for appreciating a
handsome, brilliant Baron of the Exchequer! Nevertheless,
upon the pretext of seeing safely on board the vessel
some trunk, box, packet or hamper, he visited the Petrel
every day. And he was always treated in something like
the following cavalier style. Hat in hand, he would step
on deck,—where he ever found Barbara busily engaged—and,
walking up to her, would say—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, Miss Brande! I have brought some
boxes belonging to my friend, Sir Parke.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, sir—Willful! here! see to getting up
this gentleman’s freight!” and without another word, away
she would go to attend to some other matters, in some other
part of the vessel—unceremoniously leaving “the observed
of all observers” of the fashionable drawing-rooms to bite
his nails for vexation on the deck of the vessel. He called
her “A savage! positively, a young savage! destitute of
the very first principles of civilization!”—notwithstanding
which, under the pretense of taking excellent care of some
precious piece of baggage or other, he continued his daily
visits to the Petrel. Barbara’s patience, that had lasted
six days of the week, gave way on the seventh, “which was
the Sabbath,” when she saw at the usual hour a boat come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>alongside, containing Lord Dazzleright and a quarter
cask.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, Miss Brande,” he said, as he stepped
on deck. “This is some pure port wine, for Sir Parke’s
own use——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, sir!” said Barbara, shortly—“Willful!
see that this wine is got up and stowed away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, turning to Lord Dazzleright, she said, with great
severity—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir, this is the first time that I have ever received
freight on board my vessel upon the Sabbath day, and I
hope it will be the last; and I only take it in now rather
than send you back with it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The inconceivable young bearess!” thought Lord Dazzleright,
but to her he said—“I am very sorry, Miss Brande,
I did not know your rule.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir, the rule was not one of my making; it was not I
who wrote—‘Thou shalt keep holy the Sabbath day.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg pardon—pray forgive me,” said the Baron very
humbly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ask pardon, sir, of Him whose commandment you have
set at naught.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The exasperating young Barbarian! I wonder if I
should have got a sharper sermon on Sabbath-breaking, or
received a better lesson on humility, in any chapel in London,”
said the Baron to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there any thing else to come on board?” asked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To-day?—no, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To-morrow, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Miss Brande, there are Lord Montressor’s
trunks.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, suppose that you just permit Lord Montressor’s
servants to complete this business of transportation. I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>they understand the work better, and will get through it
sooner,” said Barbara bluntly turning away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande,” exclaimed Dazzleright, going after her,
“I was presented to you by our mutual friend, Lord Montressor.
My character and position are not unknown to
you. I hope, in addition to that, you believe me to be an
honest and well-meaning man. I trust therefore that you
will not be offended when I confess to you, that the great
esteem and respect with which you have inspired me, brings
me daily to the Petrel. If there were any more regular
way of approaching you, I should gladly avail myself of it—as
it is—I am forced to this, hoping to cultivate your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“With what view?” inquired Barbara, coolly turning and
facing him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With the view that we may become better friends, Miss
Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are mad,” said Barbara, walking away and leaving
him to digest this “flat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>I am!</span>” exclaimed Dazzleright, in a rage, as he went to
the starboard gangway and beckoned the waterman to bring
his boat alongside. As he descended into that boat he
heard her clear ringing voice—commanding—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Willful! call all hands on deck. I am going to read
the Morning Service.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Umph! Umph! oh-h-h!” muttered Lord Dazzleright,
in a succession of inward grunts. “What a young barbarian!
Excepting that she seems an orthodox Christian, she
is a most unmitigated young savage! She appears to have
no more appreciation of social advantages than a swordfish—which
in character she resembles! Did the young
Vandal know that a possibility—a mere possibility was
hinted—that she might become Lady Dazzleright?” So
angry was the Baron, that on landing, he went straight to
Lord Montressor and informed him that his lordship’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>servants would have to see to the embarkation of the remainder
of the baggage. And from that day, Lord Dazzleright
went no more with box or bundle to the Petrel.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, nevertheless, upon the day before she was expected
to sail—without having informed his friends of his intention—Lord
Dazzleright boarded the Petrel, desired to see
the “Captain,” expressed his wish to take passage to America,
and inquired if he could have a berth on that vessel;
Barbara informed him plainly that he could <em>not</em>, that the
cabin was already inconveniently crowded.</p>

<p class='c013'>Whereupon Lord Dazzleright expressed his willingness
to put up with a hammock swung anywhere—in the steerage
for instance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara told him there was not a hammock to spare.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then would Miss Brande take him as freight? he asked,
smilingly.</p>

<p class='c013'>No—the hold was packed from keel to deck, and could
not stow another hundred-weight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! Miss Brande would not certainly be so unkind as
to refuse him a roost on the rigging; he could sleep on the
top,” he persevered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Dazzleright, since you force me to say it, there is
not an inch of space on board the Petrel at your disposal.
Furthermore, under any circumstances, I should decline
you as a passenger. Nor is it possible that you can ever
have a berth in my vessel unless you should chance to be
shipwrecked in our sight, in which case we should be obliged
to pick you up,” said Barbara, with great severity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I’ll go and get myself shipwrecked forthwith!”
exclaimed Lord Dazzleright.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You perceive now, sir, I am busy. Good-morning.
Avast there, Paul! what are you about!” and suddenly
breaking off, Barbara hurried forward to look after her
hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A Barbarian! a Savage! a Goth! a Vandal! a Cannibal!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>a Bearess! and the handsomest, most piquant, and
provoking young creature I ever met with in my life! Upon
my honor, I do not know which is the most inexplicable—that
I should become infatuated with this young woman, or
that she should repulse me! By my life, I do not understand
it, unless she is rabid and has bitten me, and I am
in process of becoming mad!” said the “glass of fashion,”
as with a crest-fallen air he dropped himself into the boat
and was rowed to the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>The same evening it happened that Lord Dazzleright
attended a ball at Almacks, where he was as usual the
“cynosure of neighboring eyes,” the rich prey for which
maneuvering mammas laid their plans, and mincing maidens
laid their nets.</p>

<p class='c013'>But with the usual perversity of human nature, Baron
Dazzleright obstinately refused to become enamored of any
willing Lady Clara or Geraldine among them and perseveringly
sighed after the dark-browed, eagle-eyed, lion-hearted
girl of the sea, who cared less for his baronial
coronet than for her little brother’s tarpaulin hat; less for
the title Baroness than for that of Sister Barbara; and still
less to follow the phantom of pleasure through the mazes
of fashion than to guide her “Stormy Petrel” through the
wild waves of the pathless ocean!</p>

<p class='c013'>But if this Vesta of the sea was all sufficient unto herself,—her
admirer was no longer independent of her. She had
revealed to him a phase of character as attractive, as fascinating,
as it was novel and unparalleled! Compared with
the vapid, insipid, insincere butterflies of fashion, this Barbara
Brande was so full of vital force, of truth, courage,
independence, and self-reliance! To crown all, she was a
real and thoroughly conscientious Christian. He could
not choose but think of her, and the longer he reflected,
the more he approved and admired her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaving Almacks at an early hour, he went to Gerard’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>to seek Lord Montressor, whom he found busily engaged
in writing.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, you are occupied. I will not disturb you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—only writing to Slater, my bailiff, at Montressor;
I have done now,” said his lordship, rapidly folding, directing,
and sealing the letter. “Now I am at your service.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Dazzleright threw himself into a chair, and cast his
hat into a corner.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is it? What can I do for you, Dazzleright?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are going on board to-morrow. You are in the
confidence of Miss Brande. You will be in her company
for some two or three months. Just use that opportunity
to impress upon her rather hard head, that your friend Dazzleright
is a well-meaning man, not utterly unworthy of her
consideration, even if he <em>has</em> had the misfortune to be successful
in life!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because if ever I marry a woman—her name will be
Barbara Brande!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Eh!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“If ever I marry a woman her name will be Barbara
Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are mad!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Just what she said! But—if ever I marry a woman,
her name will be Barbara Brande! Now I will tell you
what I want you to do—just let her know in a delicate
manner, that I am an honest man, who, in spite of his
coronet, is not totally beneath her notice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Prove that to her yourself in person.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ahem! I think I see her giving me the opportunity!
My friend, as long as I keep a <em>very</em> respectful distance, and
merely touch my hat on meeting her, Miss Brande treats
me with the same decent civility that she accords to the
boatmen, hucksters and porters of the Docks. But just as
soon as I presume to advance and aspire to a higher degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>of consideration, she puts me down as quietly as though
I were the Tom, Dick or Harry aforesaid. And when I
gave her to understand the honesty of my ‘intentions,’ as
the dowagers would say—she told me I was mad.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande was right in repulsing you. What has
the all-accomplished, all-praised Baron Dazzleright in
common with that free, wild, irresponsible maiden of the
ocean?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What?—nothing at all, of course! And that is the
very reason why he wants her, and why he must have her
as the complement of himself. Every quality of Barbara’s
nature will become a new possession to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the difference of rank——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Peste!</em> am I not ‘a son of the people,’ as the French
would say? Should I not take to wife ‘a daughter of the
people’? And, in one word, if I cannot get Barbara Brande
to help me found a noble dynasty—why, then, the first Lord
Dazzleright will also be the last of his illustrious line!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor arose and clapped his hand into the
palm of his friend’s, saying cordially:</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are right! I did but try you! You are altogether
right! And <em>she</em> was also right in repelling your advances—for
great reserve and firm repulsion are ever necessary
as shield and lance for a woman in her strange position.
But—barring your professional quibbling—you are worthy
of her, and if I do not find a way of convincing her of that
fact—and smoothing the path for your next overtures—why
you may then set me down as an incompetent diplomatist,
that is all.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Montressor. Well, that is just all I had
to say to you for this evening. I will not keep you out of
bed any longer, for you will have to rise early to be on
board in time, as the vessel sails with the early tide. The
sky promises fine weather for to-morrow,” said Dazzleright,
going to the window and looking out. “Well, Heaven
<span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>grant it! Good-night, my friend!” he exclaimed, returning
and offering his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-night, Dazzleright—but not good-bye,” answered
Montressor, cordially pressing his offered hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, no! certainly not! I shall meet you at St.
Catherine’s Docks to-morrow morning, and say good-bye
only on the deck of the Petrel. <em>Au revoir!</em>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To our meeting!”</p>

<p class='c006'>The next day was the fourteenth of February, and St.

the luckiest for lovers’ enterprise. The weather was as fine
as it had promised to be, with a clear sky, a soft air, and
light breeze from the south, heralding an early spring.</p>

<p class='c013'>Soon after sunrise, Sir Parke Morelle and Lord Montressor
drove down to the docks, where they found Lord Dazzleright
already awaiting them. Willful Brande was also
in attendance, with the long-boat from the Petrel, to take
the party to the vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a general greeting and shaking of hands, they entered
the long-boat and were rowed to the barque.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>The Petrel was, as always, neat and clean as a dainty
maiden in her May-day dress.</p>

<p class='c013'>The few hands were all at their posts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara walked the deck, overseeing the final arrangements,
and issuing her orders. She paused at the starboard
gangway to receive her passengers; but frowned slightly
when she recognized Lord Dazzleright among them. But
since the baron understood her reserve, he was not discomposed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are ready, and the tide is on the ebb; we only
waited to ship you before weighing anchor,” she said cordially
offering her hand to Lord Montressor, and bowing to
the two other gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So that I shall be obliged to take immediate leave of
my friends and hurry back,” said Lord Dazzleright, who had
not been addressed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, sir,” said Barbara, curtly turning away—“Willful!
have the long-boat hauled up and made fast,” she commanded.
Then to Lord Montressor and Sir Parke she
said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gentlemen, accommodate yourselves, if you please.
You know your quarters in my cabin, or if you prefer the
lock there are pleasant seats in the stern.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They bowed and begged her not to incommode herself, as
they would take care of themselves. As the men had now
hauled up the long-boat and secured it to the davits, Lord
Dazzleright began to blame his rashness, and wonder how
he should get back to the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara immediately relieved him of his dilemma by
taking her speaking trumpet, going to the side of the vessel
and hailing an idle wherry from the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Boat ahoy!—come alongside to take a passenger off!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, ay, sir!” sung out the waterman, who began to ply
his oars, swiftly propelling the boat in the direction of the
vessel. While it was coming, poor Dazzleright shook
<span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>hands with his friends, wishing them a good voyage, and
then turned to look for Barbara. She had gone forward
and was standing there to give orders.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All hands to the windlass! And you, Willful, to the
wheel!”</p>

<p class='c013'>She was obeyed on the instant, and the men and boys
stood waiting further commands.</p>

<p class='c013'>She paused, for Lord Dazzleright approached her—took
her hand and said respectfully:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-bye, and a good voyage to you, Miss Brande!
You are severe and even unjust to me; but you will know
me better; I can wait for that; God bless you and yours!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven save you, sir! Good-bye!” said Barbara, in a
somewhat softer voice, thinking that in this parting hour
she could safely relax her rigor. He understood and refrained
from presuming on this new kindness; but immediately
went to the starboard gangway and descended into
the boat, waiting there to receive him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Up anchor!” shouted Barbara, as she saw the wherry
push off.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while the men laid themselves to the windlass, and
heaved with all their strength, Lord Dazzleright stood
waving his hat from the receding boat. On reaching the
shore, with a last wave of adieu, responded to from the
decks of the vessel, Lord Dazzleright’s boat disappeared in
the crowd at the docks.</p>

<p class='c013'>The anchor was soon up, the sails all set, and the Petrel
stood gallantly out for the mouth of the river.</p>

<p class='c013'>When the vessel was thus fairly under way, Barbara
walked aft to speak to her passengers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke Morelle met her half way. Sir Parke looked
pale and unnerved. He had never made a sea voyage further
than from Dover to Calais, or from Liverpool to Cork,
in all his life, and to begin at his age to cross the Atlantic
ocean, in such an egg-shell as the Petrel, with such an extraordinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>captain as this young girl, was, notwithstanding
the opinion of Montressor,—“indiscreet—to say the least,
indiscreet.” He had stepped upon the planks of the deck
with feelings fearfully akin to those of a condemned criminal
stepping upon the flooring of a scaffold. He had watched
Barbara walking fore and aft giving her orders as though
she had been the sheriff giving directions for his execution.
Every order that she gave, and that the men obeyed, seemed
to precipitate his fate! He had serious thoughts of forfeiting
his passage money, and offering Barbara a handsome
remuneration for putting him back on shore. But a latent
confidence in Lord Montressor’s judgment and a sense of
shame for his own nervousness, restrained him from proceeding
to that length. But now meeting Miss Brande, he
accosted her with:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young woman, I would like to have a few moments
conversation with you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am at your service, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Turn about then, if you please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara complied.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now, Sir Parke Morelle was as considerable a “landlubber”
as could be found in all England or America. He
was, in his profound ignorance of nautical affairs, quite
competent to be a U. S. Secretary of the Navy. As they
walked forward he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ahem—aha. Young woman——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I beg your pardon, sir, I am called Barbara Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ahem—Miss Brande, can you rely upon your own competency
for a—for taking care of this vessel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande’s great, strong black eyes flashed down
upon him with an expression that made the autocrat of
Hyde Hall quail.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I could rely upon myself to take care of a fleet!” was
upon her tongue’s end. But Barbara possessed the rare
virtue of self-control, and pitying the poor old man who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>neither the physical courage to go fearlessly to sea with her
nor the moral courage to confess his weakness and stay
home—she answered:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Parke, I have two little brothers on board whom I
love better than my own life. They are hostages for your
safety.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not understand you, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor did I engage to furnish you with an understanding,”
thought Barbara, but repressing herself, she replied:—“Loving
Willful and Edwy as I love my own soul, I never
would have taken them on this voyage had I not known
myself in every respect fully competent to take care of the
vessel and of them, as well as any captain in the merchant’s
service could do.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you are a woman,” said Sir Parke, still hesitating.</p>

<p class='c013'>Another flash of the great black eyes, and Barbara
warming up, replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir! am I on trial for being a woman, or for
being a sea-captain, which?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For being both in one, rather,” answered the baronet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed! And why for being both in one? Has not
a woman a brain as well as a heart? Has she not courage
as well as gentleness? Fortitude as well as patience? Has
it not been proved over and over again, a thousand and a
thousand times, that in moments of danger woman have
exhibited as much presence of mind, courage, promptitude,
and skill as the best men among you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But we have elsewhere given Barbara Brande’s defense
of herself in her chosen vocation, and will not repeat it
here.</p>

<p class='c013'>The baronet was silenced if not convinced by her argument,
and presently turned the attack from the captain to
the craft.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How could such a little craft live in a stormy sea for
instance.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>Barbara’s eyes glowed, and her ripe lips wreathed in the
smile that beamed from her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How, sir, does the little sapling survive the storm that
twists off the great oak of a hundred years growth? Why,
sir, a craft like this will ride lightly on the crest of waves
that would break over and engulf a ship of the line! Why,
sir, the great waves that would thunder over the decks of a
heavy man-of-war would lift this peaceful little merchantman
and bear her on in safety—as if indeed there were a sentient
magnanimity in old ocean, which, while warring upon the
strong would spare the weak.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They now turned in their promenade and walked aft.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So you think you and the Petrel could weather a storm?
Have you any experience of the fact?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have I any experience of the fact?——Willful! what
are you about there! Will you run over that lighter?
Helm-a-lee! Helm-a lee!—steady, so!—Have I any experience
of that fact? I should think so! The little
Petrel behaves beautifully in a storm! She rides the waves
like a buoy, or lies-to snugly as a little duck! the brave
little Petrel! the bonny little Petrel!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then you have been in a storm—you have carried your
vessel safely through it?” inquired Sir Parke, as they
reached the stern, in which Lord Montressor sat with a
pocket telescope in his hand, taking sight at the villas on
the shore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor,” said Barbara, “your friend asks me
if I have ever worked this vessel through a storm. Tell him
how we weathered the gales in the Gulf Stream!—for I am
immensely tired of him,” she added, as she dropped the arm
of Sir Parke and left him on the hands of her other passenger.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara walked forward to the “caboose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Let my inland readers now imagine a little box two yards
square, on the forecastle—painted on the outside, and furnished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>inside with a store and dresser, and a full complement
of pots, pans, kettles, and crockery-ware.</p>

<p class='c013'>The presiding genius of this place was a stout, jet-black
negro woman, whose smiling eyes and ivory teeth imparted a
contented and good-humored expression to her homely face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What have you got for dinner, Climene?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dere’s a ham on a b’ilin, and I jes gwine put down a
line o’ mutton to roas’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That’s right; cook the fresh provisions every day, for
they’ll not keep, and we have no live stock to kill. And
the vegetables?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, dere’s taters, an’ cabbidge, an’ spinidge.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That will do—and the desert?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I gwine make apple pie and custard puddin’—caze you
see I tuk notice afore how Lord Monstrouser allers likes
somfin deliky.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, that will do; that will do quite well.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And leaving the namesake of the sea-nymph to her culinary
conjurations in the caboose, Barbara went down into the
cabin to lay the cloth for dinner.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have neither time nor space to follow the details of this
voyage.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the first two weeks the voyagers were blessed with
the finest weather.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in the midst of the third week the sky changed.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“And such a change, oh night, and storm, and darkness!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>March came in “like a roaring lion seeking whom he may
devour.” The wind arose in the north-west, and blowed
almost incessantly for four weeks, that is, it would blow
continuously for three days, then lull for a day, or only
“pause to gather its fearful breath,” and rise with recovered
strength, and blow harder than ever. As the vessel entered
the Gulf Stream, the weather grew worse—the gale became
a hurricane—the rough sea ran mountains high.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>But the brave little Petrel behaved beautifully, as Barbara
had said; she tacked like a skillful politician, rode the high
waves like a jockey boy, or lay-to like a duck, as occasion
required.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor and his man worked as hard as the seamen,
whenever their aid was needed. Sir Parke Morelle
was too miserably sea-sick to care one sous about the fate
of the vessel, unless it was to wish his own sufferings and
the Petrel engulfed in the same sea. His valet spent day
and night in attendance upon him.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Barbara Brande was a sight to behold. Her perfect
appreciation of the danger, combined with her perfect fearlessness,
was a subject of wonder to all. Her unwavering
courage, her undisturbed cheerfulness, her unruffled temper,
the constant firmness and serenity of her countenance, the
prompt, clear and ringing tones of her voice—heard through
the howling of the wind and the thundering of the waves,
inspired faith, and hope, and courage in every bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Only once was Barbara moved; this was when her little
brother Edwy—whom she had sent below, but who, in
sympathetic excitement, had stolen again upon deck—was,
by the pitching of the vessel, thrown violently forward, and
only saved from going overboard, by Lord Montressor, who
sprang and caught him in his arms. Barbara, pale as
monumental marble, took the boy from his lordship’s arms,
carried him below, and locked him up in the state-room for
safety. Then she reappeared on deck as cool, as firm, and
as prompt for action as before.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length the wearying and wearied wind lulled. At last
fine weather, with a fair southerly breeze, succeeded, and on
the fifth of April the Petrel entered Chesapeake Bay; and
the next day at sunset she dropt anchor off Brande’s Headland.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was with the deepest emotion that Lord Montressor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>gazed upon the spot that had become the chosen retreat of
Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>The setting sun shone full against the yellow sandy beach,
the gray, rocky bank, and flecked with golden light the
tender spring foliage of the oak trees that surrounded and
half concealed the old stone house upon the summit.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the profoundest interest he contemplated the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>That mansion was her home. There she lived, suffered
and endured. There, from some hidden covert, she had
undoubtedly wept and watched for, and gazed upon his
form; while he, unconscious of her proximity, had, gun in
hand, wandered through the woods and fields and moors
around the place.</p>

<p class='c013'>Where was she now? In or near that old gray house
undoubtedly. But what was she about?—at her lonely tea-table?—in
her parlor, reading or meditating?—in the woods,
rambling alone?—in the graveyard, ruminating? Where?
How would she receive him? Was she, perhaps, that
moment thinking of him, if not expecting him?</p>

<p class='c013'>She would be greatly surprised to see him and her father.
But would her surprise be altogether one of joy? That
she loved him was undoubtedly true. That she loved him
more than her own dearest earthly interests, and only less
than her Creator, had been proved. But would she now
consent to forget her own horrible calamity, and permit
him to make her and himself, in his own rational manner,
happy?</p>

<p class='c013'>That she had a theory of his future brilliant destiny,
which she had resolved not to dim by sharing, he had
heard. That she could be as firm as she was disinterested,
he had ascertained. Could he, then, be able to convince
her, that, to him, <em>her</em> “love was the greatest good in the
world?”</p>

<p class='c013'>But, patience—patience. Very soon these questions
must be answered—these doubts set at rest. In an hour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>he should stand face to face with his beautiful, his beloved,
his long lost, but now recovered Estelle. Till then, oh,
throbbing pulse, be still!—oh, faithful, long-suffering heart,
be hopeful! No one was on deck but Barbara and the
crew, whom she was ordering to take in sail and let go the
anchor. When she perceived her favorite passenger, she
came forward smilingly to greet him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-evening, sir. It is a glorious spring evening—the
air is as soft and balmy as that of June. You see that
we are off the old place again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-afternoon, Miss Brande. Yes, I see. Will you
permit me to inquire how long you will remain here, and
whether you will go on shore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall remain at anchor through the night, and set
sail again in the morning. And I will go on shore this
evening, for I could almost imagine the poor old place feeling
hurt if I passed it,” said Barbara, with one of her
earnest smiles.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Will you further permit me to remind you of a promise
you gave when you were here last, to show me over your
old house—one of the oldest houses in Maryland, as you
said?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara looked embarrassed, hesitated, and then replied—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord Montressor, that promise did not project itself
down all time. It was only for the day upon which it was
given. And now, I hope you will excuse me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor bowed. “If you wish to go on shore,
sir, the long-boat, is, of course, at your service; but I cannot
invite you to the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I should feel obliged to you, my dear Miss
Brande, to give me a seat when you yourself go on shore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will do that with pleasure, sir.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke Morelle now waked up from his after-dinner
nap, came on deck, and joined Montressor. Barbara
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>bowed and left them alone together while she went forward
to give orders for the long-boat to be prepared.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is your daughter’s home, Sir Parke,” said Lord
Montressor, pointing to the dreary Headland, now growing
darker under the thick falling shadows of evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heaven! what a desolate place!” exclaimed the
baronet, in consternation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; but I can well imagine that the desolation of the
heart within should have rendered her insensible to the
desolation of the scene without,” replied Montressor,
solemnly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not perhaps feeling the latent rebuke hidden in these
words, the baronet continued to gaze upon the picturesque
Headland, until the long-boat was reported ready.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am going on shore—will you accompany me now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course! of course! I will accompany you now,”
replied the baronet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara came up dressed in the gray serge gown, sacque
and hood that was her usual out-door costume.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sir Parke has also decided to go on shore, Miss
Brande,” said Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very good, sir,” said Barbara, betraying some little
distrust and anxiety—“the boat awaits your convenience,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are ready to attend you, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They went to the starboard gangway, where Lord Montressor
led the way down the ladder, and having reached
the boat, he put up his hand to assist Barbara in the descent;
a courtesy which the girl accepted solely on the
principle of politeness, for in truth, so far from requiring
such assistance, she was rather embarrassed by its offer, as
well as impeded by its forced acceptance. By the same
ready hand, Sir Parke was next helped down the ladder.
And when they were all seated, the oarsmen plied their
oars, and the long-boat glided swiftly over the starlit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>waters toward the Headland that loomed darkly above
them. In a few moments, the boat touched the sand, and
was pushed up under the heavy shadows of the overhanging,
wooded bank.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What a place to land in! It is like entering Hades,”
said Sir Parke, as they got out of the boat and stood upon
the beach.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Take the boat back to bring off the boys,” ordered
Miss Brande.</p>

<p class='c013'>And when she was left alone with her passengers, she
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, gentlemen, how can I serve you? How will you
amuse yourselves? The sporting season is long over.
And I regret to say that I am not at liberty to invite you
up to the house.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then, Miss Brande, we must waive ceremony and proceed
without invitation,” said Lord Montressor, gently, as
if to atone in his manner for any seeming rudeness in his
words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What can you mean, sir?” inquired Barbara, with increased
distrust and anxiety.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>“Pardon me, Miss Brande. You cannot but have
guessed the object of Sir Parke Morelle’s voyage to
America?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am no Yankee, sir; yet, of course, as you say, I have
surmised that the father comes but in quest of his daughter,”
replied Barbara, with a glance full of sympathy toward
the baronet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke responded by slightly lifting his hat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And would you, Miss Brande, knowing the present
home of that long-lost daughter, suffer her father, in his
ignorance of her retreat, to leave the spot far behind, to
pursue his unavailing search in another hopeless direction?”
inquired Lord Montressor, solemnly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara did not at once reply, but seemed buried in profound
reflection, as if seeking the clue to some unexplained
mystery.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor could scarcely repress his vehement impatience.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Miss Brande?” he said, anxiously regarding her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, sir,” replied Barbara, gravely, “I perceive that
you have somehow discovered the retreat of this lady. I
only trust that it has been through no indiscretion on my
part.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have. She is your recluse tenant. And we have
learned this fact through no inadvertency of yours.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since this is so,” said Barbara, earnestly, “I will admit,
that I am glad of it. Knowing, or rather believing as I
did, that yourself and her father were on the way to seek
her where she could not be found, in the city of Baltimore,
my heart, through all the voyage, ached because I was not
permitted to say to you—‘She whom you seek is my tenant
at the Headland.’ Thank Heaven, that without any breach
of faith on my part, you are informed of it. Sir Parke”—she
said, turning and addressing the baronet—“you will
let your daughter know this.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>“I will, Miss Brande. How shall we get up this steep?
It is a very dark night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will show you. Follow me, if you please. Lord
Montressor! I really think you had better give your arm
to Sir Parke. The ascent is very difficult even in daylight,
and now we can scarcely discern the cedar thickets from
the chasms in the rocks,” said Barbara, as she carefully led
the way up the bank.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor took the hand of the old man, and with
a wildly throbbing heart, that all his resolution could not
quiet, followed. A few moments more—a few swift, vital
moments more and he should see her—should hear her
speak—should clasp her living hand! Oh! wild impatient
heart be still—be still—it is but an instant, and then! and
then!</p>

<p class='c013'>They toiled up the bank; they reached the top, and then
the old trees waving in the night wind, and the old house
looming in the darkness, stood before them. A gloomy,
foreboding, funereal atmosphere overshadowed the place.
Hope sickened as she looked upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is as dark as Erebus! There is not a light to be
seen in all the house, and not a sound to be heard without.
I hope the mistress and her maid have not yet retired,”
said Lord Montressor, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, sir! I think not. The lady’s chamber, which
is also her usual sitting-room, and the maid’s kitchen, are
both in the back part of the building. I will ring.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And going up the rickety steps of the portico, Barbara
rang a peal, and waited a minute—two minutes—but no
advancing light was seen; no coming step was heard. She
rang louder.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ting-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling-a-ling!</p>

<p class='c013'>The peal was re-echoed through the great, desolate house,
with a strange, vacant, hollow reverberation!</p>

<p class='c013'>Then followed a dead silence; they waited anxiously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>and tried in the darkness to read the expression in each
other’s faces. Three minutes passed like an age, and Barbara
pulled the bell-handle with all her strength.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ting! a-ling! a-ling! a-ling! <span class='fss'>A-LANG! A-LANG! LANG!</span></p>

<p class='c013'>It sounded through the vast gloomy house with a clamor
and a clangor loud enough to rouse the old dead ancestors
in the burial-ground beyond; it awoke nothing but the
dreary, wailing, ghostly echo!</p>

<p class='c013'>Five minutes of anxious waiting, peering and listening,
passed, and then Barbara jerked the bell-handle a third time,
with peril to the ropes.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='sc'>Clang! a-rang! a-rang! rang! rang! rang! RANG!</span></p>

<p class='c013'>It seemed enough to have shaken the old chimneys to
their base, and started the slates from the roof!</p>

<p class='c013'>But only the phantom Echo was within to wail forth her
weird response!</p>

<p class='c013'>They looked at each other, with dimly visible, troubled
white faces, gleaming faintly in the surrounding darkness
For some moments, no one spoke; each seemed fearful to
give voice to his or her forebodings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Had Death been there before them, and forever set the
seal of the grave upon Estelle’s earthly fate, and rendered
vain, as far as life was concerned, her father’s late relenting?</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor’s deep troubled voice first broke the
silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande, what think you of this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I dare not yet think,” replied Barbara, in a tremulous
tone; “but we will go around to the back part of the
house, and see if we can discover any thing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And carefully descending the rickety stairs, she groped
her way around to the rear of the dwelling. The two
gentlemen followed her. But at the back as at the front,
all was shut up, dark and still. No sign of human habitation
was near the place.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>“Miss Brande,” exclaimed Lord Montressor, in voice of
anguish, “what is the meaning of this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The Lord only knows!” responded Barbara, in great
agitation. “But, follow me, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are you going?” inquired Sir Parke Morelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Down to a cabin at the foot of the bank, where two
old negroes live who may be able to give us some satisfaction.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And hurrying onward, she began the difficult descent of
the steep, with a precipitancy more indicative of haste and
anxiety than of a regard for her own life and limbs.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gentlemen followed with all speed consistent with Sir
Parke’s infirmities.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the foot of the bank she ran against the boys, just
landed from the boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, where in the world are you running to, sister?”
exclaimed Willful, when stopped by the wild and hurrying
figure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To Uncle Nep’s cabin! The house above is abandoned!
Follow me. But where is the boat?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is just putting off,” replied Willful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Boat ahoy!” she called—“come back and wait for us
at the foot of the ash tree.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, who had by this time helped Sir Parke
down the descent, now joined her. She also heard the
light splash of the oars of the returning boat, and knew by
the sound which followed that it was pushed up on the
sands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, now,” she said, and hurried along under the
overhanging bank until she came to a place where the bluff
suddenly sunk into a little bowl-like hollow, where, closely
sheltered and deeply shaded even at noonday by the overarching
trees, stood the little cabin, with its single dip
candle gleaming through the tiny window out into the deep
darkness.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>Willful ran forward and rapped at the door, which was
immediately opened by the namesake of the Ocean Queen,
who called out—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who dar?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It’s me, Aunt Amphitrite,” replied the grammar-despising
lad.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lors a messy pon top o’ my soul, if it aint de chile!
Hi, boy, where you come from? Drop right outen the sky,
didn’t yer? Come in, chile! Come in! Lors a messy,
come in outen de night air! Where’s your sister?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Here I am, Aunty, and here are strangers,” said Barbara,
as she came up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lors, Miss Barbra, chile, I’se so ’joyed to see yer, ’deed
I is; but what made you go for to fetch strangers here
and ketch me in my ole, ebery-day duds? Ef you’d a only
guve me time I’d a put on my black silk gown as dat dear,
bressed, free-hearted chile, Miss Estel, guve me for a Sunday
gown! An’ dere’s my ole man in dere a fuming de
whole place wid his ’bacco, like a saint in de odor o’ sanctity,
which I knows as white folks don’t like! Heave it
away, you mis-beguided ole sinner you, an’ let de white
folks in!” cried Amphitrite, breaking off from her discourse
to take the pipe from her dark liege lord’s lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind his smoking, Amphy! We do not want
to come in! Ask your husband to come here to the door;
we wish to speak to you both,” said Barbara, who with her
heart pausing with dread, now that she had arrived at the
spot, seized the slightest pretext for delaying the question
upon which the happiness of so many hung.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man came bending toward the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How does you do, Miss Barbra, honey? ’Deed I’se
mighty proud to see you! How do, Mars’t Edwy, honey?
How de chile do grow!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am very glad to see you so well, Neptune, but have
no time nor heart for compliments now, old man,” said Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>Brande, when she saw that Sir Parke Morelle and Lord
Montressor had come up and were now standing near her,
in great anxiety. “Tell me, Neptune! What has become
of Mrs. Estel?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The hearts of all suspended their action while waiting
the slow reply of the old man. It came at last in the form
of another question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Estel, honey?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De beaut’ful chile as lib up yonder?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes. Yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“De one as you rent de ole house to?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! Yes! Yes! Oh! speak at once, and tell us
where she is!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Done gone.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gone! we know it! but <span class='fss'>WHERE</span>?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dat’s what I can’t tell you, honey. She done gone
’way in a wessel!—she an’ de young ’oman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Thank Heaven that their worst fears were set at rest.
She was not “gone” out of the world! she was still living!
they had still a future! all breathed more freely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But surely you know something about the lady’s departure?
Come! collect your faculties, Neptune, and tell
us what you do know!” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed I doesn’t know a singly thing more’n I’se telled
yer; an’ dat’s de Hebenly Marster’s trufe!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Don’t you know <em>when</em> the lady went?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed, honey, she went t’other week; but de zact one
I could not ’form you; dough ’haps my ole ’oman might.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What an idiotic creature!” exclaimed Sir Parke Morelle,
in disgust.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor remained silently and intently listening
“Amphitrite, can you tell me when Mrs. Estel went?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Bout a mont’ ago, chile!—’deed she!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where did she go?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>“’Deed, chile, Miss Susan—she ’cline for to tell me,
when I ax her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You don’t know where she went, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed, Lord knows don’t I, honey! I wish to de Lord
how I did!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was the name of the vessel she sailed by?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Clare to Marster, honey, I couldn’t tell you, being as
how I don’t know myself.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor the name of the captain?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Nor likewise de name o’ de cappen, chile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Umph! Was the vessel she sailed in going up or down
the Bay?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed Lors-a-mity knows, I couldn’t ’form you which,
Miss Barbra—case de wessel come to anchor some time in
de night, and den next night, some time ’fore day, she
sailed ag’in. So we nebber seen whedder she came up or
down when she ’riv’, or whedder she go up or down when
she lef’.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But surely you can tell us which way her prow
pointed?” asked Barbara, catching at this faint clue as the
drowning catch at straws.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I donno what you mean by the <em>prow</em>, honey.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her head, then. In which direction was her head?
Where did her head point? Up or down?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, chile, when <em>I</em> seen her, her head pointed straight
up in de <em>sky</em>, wid a blue an’ white flag aflyin’ from the top
of it! least ways it wer a blue groun’ wid a ’mendous big
white cross on it, as Miss Susan said, wer a Union Jack—which
<em>Jack</em> being short for Jonathan, and <em>Union</em> meanin’
de United States—made me think how she must a’ been
a ’Merican ship. But any ways, long as yer so anxious
to know, her head pointed straight up to de sky!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh dear me, Amphy! we are not talking of the <em>mast</em>
head, but of the prow—the forepart of the vessel!” said
Barbara, impatiently.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>“’Den ’clare to my ’Vine Master I doesn’t know de head
from de tail!” retorted the Ocean Queen.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Neptune! can you inform me whether, when you saw
that vessel at anchor in the day time, her prow pointed up
or down the bay?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed, honey, she stood neyther up <em>nor</em> down the Bay;
but right <em>crossways</em>, wid her prow pintin’ right in toward
the Headland here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Satisfactory! And you do not know, Neptune,
whether she went up or down the Bay?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed, honey, I don’t know nuffin ’tall, ’bout ’cept what
I’se already telled you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Did the lady leave a letter or a message with either of
you?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Clare to Marster, honey, de chile didn’t leave no letter
’long of us, nor likewise no message cept ’twas to give her
love an’ de Lor’ might bless you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It were tedious to repeat the close and severe cross-questioning
to which the old people were subjected. Suffice it
to say that the catechism proved fruitless. The old couple
had already informed their mistress of all they had learned
upon the subject of the mysterious flitting.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length Barbara said, “It is barely possible, my lord,
that she has left a note or letter for me upon her dressing-table,
or somewhere in the house. Shall we get lights,
proceed thither, and examine the premises?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor bowed in silence. His heart was too
heavily oppressed with despair for many words.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara told the old man to light a lantern and attend
them back to the old house. And once more the whole
party, preceded by the old man with the light, traversed
the winding beach, ascended the weary bluff, and stood before
the half-ruined mansion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Neptune, who had the keys as well as the lantern, unlocked
the front door and admitted them.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>The damp, dreary wind that must have blown out the
light had it not been protected by the glass lantern, was the
only thing that welcomed them.</p>

<p class='c013'>They went into the barely furnished parlor, where Barbara
found every thing standing as it had stood for years;
but no note or letter on table, stand, or mantle-shelf.
They next passed into her bed-chamber, where they found
every thing in order, but no note or letter. They visited
the kitchen and Susan Copsewood’s sleeping-room with no
more successful results. And at last, after a thorough but
fruitless examination of the whole premises, they were
forced to abandon the hopeless search.</p>

<p class='c013'>“All clue seems lost,” exclaimed the baronet, in despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor could not suppress a deep groan. His
strong heart seemed about to break beneath this new blow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Let us hope,” said Barbara. “We set sail from London
for the port of Baltimore, where you, first of all, expected
to find her. Let us proceed on our voyage. We
may yet come up with her in Baltimore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven grant it!” exclaimed the baronet, whose anxiety
to find his lost daughter increased with the difficulty and
delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara then gave the old man, Neptune, the money and
packets of groceries that she had brought for him; completed
the other little arrangements that had brought her
to the shore; took her leave of her old servants, and, accompanied
by her disappointed and saddened passengers,
returned to the vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Assembled around the little centre-table of the cabin, they
held another consultation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Had Estelle no friends or neighbors in this place, with
whom she might have left a letter or message?” inquired
Lord Montressor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, there are none nearer than Eastville. And yet
now that I think of it, she may have left some charge with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>my attorney at that village. So if you think best, we will
lie at anchor over to-morrow, to ride up thither to make
inquiries. What say you, gentlemen?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Undoubtedly, that is the plan,” replied Lord Montressor
and Sir Parke.</p>

<p class='c013'>The party then separated for the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>Early the next morning they went on shore. Old Neptune,
being ordered, quickly put the horses to the carry-all.
Sir Parke and Miss Brande entered and took the back seat.
Lord Montressor and Willful sat in front. The boy took
the reins. After a rapid drive of two hours, they reached
Eastville, and drew up before the lawyer’s office.</p>

<p class='c013'>Miss Brande alighted and entered, where she found the
lawyer seated at his desk, writing. He instantly arose and
came forward to meet her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good-morning, Miss Brande. Pray take a seat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, no sir. My tenant, Mrs. Estel, has left
the Headland. Has she possibly charged you with any
letter or message for me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Letter? Yes, Miss Brande; here it is,” answered the
lawyer, going to his desk and producing the missive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara almost snatched it from his hand, tore it open,
and glanced eagerly along its lines. Then, with a deep
sigh, she went out and read it to Sir Parke and Lord Montressor.
It ran thus:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>My Dear Miss Brande</span>:—In withdrawing from the
Headland, for an indefinite number of years, I do not throw
up the lease; but leaving the key in charge of Neptune, I

lease.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>“And that is all!” simultaneously exclaimed the father
and the lover.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They were not contented. They left the carriage and
went into the office of the lawyer whom they minutely questioned.
But he could tell them absolutely nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>They re-entered the carriage, and, at Barbara’s suggestion,
drove to the dwelling of the parish clergyman.</p>

<p class='c013'>This venerable man had attended Estelle in her illness;
but he could give them no satisfaction as to her present
retreat. All further inquiries in that neighborhood proved
fruitless. Evidently Estelle had concealed from all, the
place of her destination.</p>

<p class='c013'>With heavy hearts they returned to their vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next morning they set sail for Baltimore, where they
duly arrived.</p>

<p class='c013'>For weeks Sir Parke and Lord Montressor pursued their
search through the city. Then finding all their efforts unavailing,
they took leave of Barbara Brande and of Baltimore,
and began a tour of all the principal cities in the
United States. Meanwhile they appointed an agent in
New York to whom all communications for themselves were
to be addressed. Then they inserted in all the newspapers,
carefully-worded advertisements, designed to be understood
by Estelle alone, and to be answered through this agent.</p>

<p class='c013'>After several months of fruitless travel, search, and anxious
waiting, it occurred to Sir Parke that his daughter
might possibly have returned to her native country. And
acting upon this idea, and still accompanied by his intended
son-in-law, the baronet sailed for England.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Estelle had been too strong to die.</p>

<p class='c013'>With the skillful attention of the village physician, the
devoted care of her faithful servant, and the fervent prayers
of the parish minister, she had recovered from her long and
dangerous illness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first use she made of her convalescence was to abandon
the Headland House.</p>

<p class='c013'>Since the first exciting visit of Lord Montressor to the
place, the scene had become insufferable to her. To fly
from it, or to lose her reason seemed the only alternative.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ah! it is a comparatively easy thing, in some exalted
mood of mind, to make a supreme offering of affection to
the shrine of duty—as easy as self-slaughter is, if that were
required! for the wrench of parting, like the throws of
death, is but a short agony! But such voluntary immolation
is not self-slaughter, it is more, it is the self-inhumation
of the living! The heart thus cut off from the love which
is its life, does not find the peace of death but the dull anguish
of the living tomb—it cannot die, but continues to
throb, to yearn and to suffer. Thus the <span class='fss'>TEST</span> is not in the
fierce struggle with temptation and the keen pangs of sacrifice,
but in the terrible reaction; in the dull gnawing pain
of all the after time; in the aching sense of bereavement,
loneliness and utter desolation; in the long succession of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>dreary, weary days that dawn without hope, and decline
without comfort—each an added link to the heavy chain of
hapless years, that drag the spirit to the dust; years of
slow heart-wasting; years of death in life!</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle had thought, when she had severed herself from
her lover, that the struggle and the agony was over and
the victory won. And after the torture of the criminal
trial, and the pitiless battery of myriad eyes that had fallen
upon her defenseless head, and after the moral warfare between
her deep affections and her high sense of duty,—after
all the tempestuous, thronged, and trying scenes through
which she had been dragged,—worn out in frame and exhausted
in spirit, <em>rest</em> had seemed welcome and <em>solitude</em> inviting.
She had sighed for “a lodge in some vast wilderness,
some boundless contiguity of shade.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She had sought and found in the Headland such a retreat.
The very desolation and dreariness of the locality had
attracted her. The solitary gloom of the dark pine woods,
the sterile brow of the bank, and the lonely waste of waters
accorded well with her soul’s sadness. The melancholy
days of Autumn—“the saddest in the year;” the incessant
weeping of the skies; the unceasing wailing of the wind;
the perpetual sighing of the trees for their ever falling
leaves; the monotonous moaning of the sea;—all harmonized
with the dirge-like, mournful music of her own
spirit.</p>

<p class='c013'>But this mood was in itself, morbid and temporary. It
would not have lasted, even had Lord Montressor never
arrived at the Headland to break it up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unsuspecting her presence at the house, he had appeared.
Unseen by him, she had watched him from her window.
Stifling the mighty hunger of her heart, she had suffered
him to depart.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then had come the crisis of the fever.</p>

<p class='c013'>After her recovery—to remain upon that spot associated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>with the memory of his short and sad visit; in that house so
void, so lonely, so cheerless; without a companion, without
an occupation; without an interest in life; to rise each
morning without object; to lie down each night without
sleep; to put away day after day, week after week, month
after month, the longing desire to hear from him, to write
to him, to go after him; to continue such a life and not
go mad, was difficult—was impossible.</p>

<p class='c013'>To save herself from this last worst evil, she resolved to
shut up the house and leave the Headland; to go—somewhere,
anywhere, she knew not, cared not,—whither!</p>

<p class='c013'>If her journey should only afford her change of scene,
and distraction from one clinging grief—that would be
enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>At this extremity of need, when she was scarcely competent
to the conducting of her own course, providence sent
her unhoped for aid and advice.</p>

<p class='c013'>This came in the form of old Mr. Goodloe, the parish
clergyman, who had visited, pitied, and prayed for her
during her severe illness.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Reverend Barnabas Goodloe, was not a man of any
great depth of feeling, breadth of intellect, or extent of experience.
But he had passed the greater portion of a long
life, in performing the quiet duties of a country clergyman.
For forty years he had preached simple sermons to a rustic
congregation; had married young men and maidens; christened
children; buried the dead; counseled the living;
comforted the afflicted; visited the sick; and relieved the
poor of the parish of Eastville. But in all his life, so interesting
an object as Estelle had never crossed his path.
In his capacity of clergyman, he had been called to her bedside
to pray for her recovery, by Susan Copsewood, who
had a great and saving faith in “the effective, fervent prayer
of a righteous man,” and who ascribed her beloved lady’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>restoration to health, not so much to the skill of the physician,
as to the petitions of the pastor.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Mr. Goodloe could not forget the sweet pale face,
and deep, soft tones, and gentle manners of the beautiful
sufferer, in whom at the very first sight, he had felt so keen
an interest. And though she did not belong to his congregation,
and had not once appeared in his church, nor yet
had, in thanking him for his attention, invited him to call
again; despite his dread of being considered intrusive, he
felt irresistibly impelled to pay her a visit.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle received him with the gentle courtesy for which
she was distinguished, again thanked him for his kind attentions
during her illness; and afterward on receiving his
adieu requested him to come again. Probably her first
omission of this civility had been unintentional. At least
so reasoned the aged minister, who soon repeated his visit
to Estelle, between whom and himself a mutual esteem arose.</p>

<p class='c013'>On one of these visits, after contemplating her despairing
but most lovely face, and noticing that it grew visibly thinner,
paler, and more shadowy, he took her slender hand and
said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My child, I would not for the world seek to intrude
upon your confidence; but your countenance too plainly
betrays that you are the victim of some deep, consuming,
almost incurable grief. Whatever that grief may be—and
I do not seek to know—this dreary scene and lonely life is
not the way to wrestle with it successfully; for it is overcoming
you—you are dying under it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Were that all, indeed, that were well!” replied the lady
mournfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not so, my child; for life has duties. You have no
right to drop the burden of existence; we must all first
earn the Heavenly rest. You are not a native of this place,
lady; for you there is no healing in these solitary scenes;
you must arise and go hence; you have means; go into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>the crowded city; seek out the unfortunate with which the
lanes and alleys are thronged—find the lost men, the wretched
women, and destitute children; forget your own, in ministering
to their greater sorrows.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Greater sorrows’, good Heavens!” echoed Estelle, in
mournful incredulity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! <em>greater</em> sorrows! however great yours may be—I
repeat that there are many, very many who all their mortal
lives labor under greater sorrows. You—whatever your
grief may be—have youth, health, beauty, intellect, education,
competence, a conscience void of offense, and, above
all, you are not ‘without God in the world.’ Your single
sorrow is a disappointment, or a bereavement. That is all
you probably have to suffer. But for many others,—to
disappointment, and to bereavement, is added age, illness,
famine, cold, squalor, the evils of ignorance, the remorse of
guilt,—and under all the horrors of a practical atheism!
Behold! I have given you a glimpse of an existing Gehenna,
of which you had never heard or dreamed; but to which
you will go as a ministering, and redeeming angel.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle was deeply moved; pale and breathless she arose
and placing her hand in that of the pastor, murmured faintly:
“That is my work. I thank you for indicating it. I
will go.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He laid his hand on her head—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go! an unprofessed sister of charity, among the poor,
the ignorant, the sick, and the prisoners. Go! hand-maiden
of the Man of Sorrows, follow Him in works of mercy, and
He will give you His ‘peace—not as the world giveth will
He give it you.’ And so God bless you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the good old man departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>And she did not sink again into the bathos of a self-indulgent
sorrow. She went to work and prepared for her
mission. She set her house in order; visited the quarters
of her humble friends, the old negro couple, and added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_456'>456</span>many substantial comforts to their cabin. She wrote a
letter of adieu to her landlady, Barbara Brande, and committed
it to the care of her attorney to be delivered. Then
she closed her house, left the keys, for the convenience of
the proprietor, with old Neptune, took leave of her few
lowly acquaintances, and, accompanied by her devoted attendant,
departed without leaving behind any clue to her
destination.</p>

      <div class='line'>“On! on! our moments hurry by</div>
      <div class='line'>Like shadows of a passing cloud.”—<cite>Bowring.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Five years have elapsed since the events recorded in our
last chapter, and six since the fatal incident with which this
story opened.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke and Lady Morelle, after having used every
means in their power for the recovery of their daughter, gave
up the search in despair, and retired to Hyde Hall, where,
year after year, they lived in a sort of hopeless watching for
some one circumstance to arise that might guide them to a
knowledge of her home.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lord Montressor, after long and fruitless efforts to discover
the retreat of his lost love, unable to endure life
amid scenes so associated with vain hopes and memories of
Estelle, had accepted service under the Crown and represented
his sovereign at one of the highest continental
courts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Still young, eminently handsome, accomplished and graceful,
endowed with great wealth, high rank and the distinguished
favor of his sovereign, he moved, “the cynosure
<span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>of neighboring eyes,” among the youthful, beautiful, and
gifted of his own and other countries. But no second love
displaced his lost Estelle, no transient fancy for a single
instant disputed her home in his heart. Her memory was
dearer to his soul, than the most beautiful woman’s presence;
the faint hope of some day finding her, was sweeter than
the highest aspirations of his worldly ambition. Her idea
filled his whole heart, from which it was never for an instant
absent. He loved her above all created beings, with a
pure, passionate, undying love—with a longing, hoping,
praying love. He understood and honored the motives of
her self-sacrifice. And be sure, that if ever he shall find
her, he will hasten to lay at her feet an unchanged heart.</p>

<p class='c013'>A year previous to the time at which we resume the
thread of our story, Lord Montressor, by the death of a
distant relative, had succeeded to the title and estates of
the Earldom of Eagletower. And six months after this
new accession of dignity his lordship had been ordered by
the government upon a secret and most important diplomatic
mission to the city of Washington. To vail the
political aspect of his voyage, as well as to form a pleasant
party, Lord Eagletower (as we must now call him), had
invited Sir Parke and Lady Morelle and Lord Dazzleright
to accompany him to the United States. The baronet and
his lady, weary of Hyde Hall, needing a change, and vaguely
hoping to hear of their daughter in the country in which
she had been last seen, accepted the invitation. Lord Dazzleright,
who had never visited America, was glad to avail
himself of the present opportunity of doing so in the company
of his friends. Thus it was in May, 184-, five years
from the time when they had lost sight of Estelle, that the
whole party sailed for the United States, where they arrived
safely in June.</p>

<p class='c013'>But where meanwhile, was Estelle? The scenes that
had known her, now “knew her no more.” Save in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>hearts of the few who loved her, her memory seemed to
have perished from the face of the earth. Yet, in the far
distant, great metropolis of the western world, the poor,
the sick, the imprisoned, the all-suffering, daily invoked
blessings on the head of a dark-robed, lovely lady, whose
beautiful pale face was seldom unvailed, save by the side of
the invalid, the destitute, or the sorrowful, and whom those
who gratefully remembered her in their prayers, called by
the name of “Estel.” How or where this angel visitant
lived, not one among her proteges knew. But, day after
day, and week after week, this child of wealth, luxury and
refinement might have been seen in the squalid haunts of
poverty, disease and ignorance, sitting beside the fetid bed,
breathing the sickening air, waiting upon the often repulsive
objects of illness. And this not for one month, or two,
but month after month, and year after year, for the whole
lustrum during which her friends had lost sight of her.
And not in vain, for, with her, into miserable dwellings
came light, knowledge, and purity; and before her fled
ignorance, prejudice, and disease. The close room would
be thrown open to the reviving air of heaven; the heated
clothing renewed; the parched lips and burning skin of
fever refreshed with coldest water; and, above all, the fainting
and despairing spirit raised and guided to the feet of
the all-merciful Physician of souls, who never yet sent a
suppliant away unhealed. And oh, how often her slender
hand has been clasped in tearful gratitude, and prayers and
blessings have greeted her coming, and followed her departure?
And those who prayed for the lovely minister
of mercy, besought the compassionate Father of love to
look down in pity upon her who pitied all other sufferers,
and to lift from her palest brow that heavy cloud of strange
sorrow that overshadowed it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Such, for five years, had been the life, labors, and consolations
of Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>And our favorite, Barbara Brande, the handsome Amazon,
the brave girl-captain, what of her and her boy brothers,
who must have almost reached the bourne of manhood?</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara was now twenty-seven years of age. Under
favorable circumstances, woman should continue to grow
handsomer until her thirtieth year. Whether the beautiful
Amazon was under such auspices or not, it is certain that
at twenty-seven she was a much finer-looking woman than
she had been at twenty-two. She had continued her sea life,
and had prospered therein. The little brigantine, the
Petrel, had been exchanged for the “Ocean Queen.” Her
crew was quadrupled, and each hand had been selected with
the greatest care and caution. Her brothers had nearly
reached man’s estate, and were now able to sustain her
authority in cases of exigency. Her trade had greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a word, Barbara Brande had but one living regret.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was caused by the conduct of her eldest and favorite
brother, Willful. Now, do not hasten to conclude that
young Willful Brande contracted evil habits, for such a
judgment would be the very antipodes of justice.</p>

<p class='c013'>A nobler-hearted, or more upright youth than Willful
Brande never lived. He comprehended and appreciated
his brave and beautiful sister, and thence he loved and
honored her above all creatures on earth; and also, thence
he was her greatest comfort and her best beloved; her
“right-hand man,” her “gallant mate,” her “beau,” were
some of the playful pet names she had bestowed on him.
Her “rudder,” her “sheet-anchor,” her “storm-staysail,”
were other earnest synonyms for her brother, Willful
Brande.</p>

<p class='c013'>He resembled his sister. In the tall, lithe, strong and
graceful figure, in the well-turned neck and stately head, in
the clean cut, noble features; in the jet-black curling hair,
and the full commanding eyes, he seemed the very counterpart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>of Barbara. Had they exchanged dresses, the one
might have been taken for the other. And as this grand
style of beauty was rather masculine than feminine, it proved
even more attractive in Willful than in Barbara. Willful
Brande had continued to be his sister’s greatest pride and
joy, until he approached his sixteenth year. Then the
youth conceived the ambitious idea of entering the United
States Navy, and gave his sister no peace until she had,
through an influential friend of her family—General ——,
one of the senators from her State, procured for him a midshipman’s
warrant. And Willful Brande now rejoiced in a
naval uniform, and looked forward to the time when he
should wear the epaulets.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Barbara, with Edwy for mate, still commanded the
Ocean Queen.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXXIV.<br> <span class='c011'>THE HEIRESS OF THE ISLE.</span></h2>
</div>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus from within and from without,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>She grew a flower of mind and eye</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas love that circled her about,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And love that made her quick reply.”—<cite>Sterling.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Changes had also in this time passed over the charming
sea-girt island and its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile from a beautiful child, had grown into a most
beautiful maiden. Her form was of medium size and of exquisite
symmetry. Her golden ringlets were more sunny
bright, her smooth forehead more snowy-white, her blooming
cheeks and lips flushed with a richer carnation, her blue
eyes softened with a deeper tenderness. All her motions
were perfect grace, all her tones perfect melody.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>Her mind was one of the finest order, and was well cultivated,
because she had followed up her earlier course of
instruction by diligently reading the numerous volumes carefully
selected for her use, by Julius Luxmore. She was
passionately fond of music and of painting, to the study of
which she had first been introduced by the accomplished
Madame L’Orient, and which, of late years, she had, with
the aid of manuals, enthusiastically cultivated. For the
rest the beautiful girl was blessed with the sweetest temper
and the gayest spirit. And thus, taken all for all in all, she
was the moral sunshine of the Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore continued the honored friend and confidential
agent of Monsieur Henri De L’Ile. He sought by
every means to ingratiate himself into the confidence, esteem,
and affection of the master, the heiress, and even the negroes
of the Island. He was handsome in person, plausible in
sentiment, and pleasing in address. He seemed a miracle
of ability, honor and benevolence. The master distinguished
him, the servants lauded him, and Etoile having few to love
in the world, loved him; but it was with a younger sister’s
innocent, confiding affection.</p>

<p class='c013'>And even if in some unguarded hour, when his mask of
fair seeming was not fitted closely, Etoile with her fine
feminine instinct faintly perceived that he was not in all
respects perfect excellence, she quickly suppressed this
idea, accusing herself of injustice and all uncharitableness.
She absolutely <em>saw</em> nothing wrong in Julius Luxmore;
there appeared to be no <em>reason</em> for her occasional
suspicions of his soundness of integrity, and therefore she
repelled those suspicions as both unjust and ungenerous.</p>

<p class='c013'>For with all her mental and moral wealth—with her
strength of intellect and warmth of affection, this beautiful
young recluse of the isle, cut off from communication with
all the rest of the world, was the most unsophisticated
child of nature, entirely innocent of the knowledge of conventional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>life. If she always moved, spoke, and acted
with the most exquisite politeness, it was because her soul
was as gracious as her person was graceful. And if sometimes
she made quaint mistakes, they were always the
natural mistakes of a pure heart that thinketh no evil.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore had done all that man could do to recommend
himself to her good opinion. He taxed his invention
to increase her resources of interest and amusement.</p>

<p class='c013'>In his frequent visits to the cities of the main land he
collected the rarest and most attractive books, pictures,
statuettes, vases, and ornamental, useful or instructive
objects of every description.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the Island, he had a green-house built and filled with
the rarest exotics, that she might enjoy flowers all the
year round. Adjoining the green-house, he caused an
aviary to be erected, which he peopled with the finest song
birds of our own and other countries. These conservatories
were connected by glass doors with the favorite parlor
and bed-chamber of Etoile, which now occupied the
right hand side of the hall on the first floor. And thus
the young heiress could at all seasons of the year enjoy the
perfume of flowers, and the songs of birds.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Island was, as I have already said, a mile in diameter,
and three miles in circumference. Mr. Luxmore caused a
road to be cleared around the whole circuit of the Isle
above the beach, that Etoile might have a long three-mile
race-course. And on his next visit to New York, he purchased
from a celebrated riding-school a lady’s trained
palfrey—a beautiful silvery white Arabian, which, together
with a rich saddle and bridle, he shipped and conveyed to
the Island for the use of Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of all the presents that he had brought, this the most
delighted the young girl. And she cordially expressed
her thanks. It was Mr. Luxmore who first lifted her into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>the saddle, and taught her to guide her horse—it was Mr.
Luxmore who was her constant companion in riding.</p>

<p class='c013'>I will sketch one day, that the reader may judge how
the beautiful young Islander, without companions of her
own age, passed her time.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the rising of the sun, the jubilant matin songs of the
myriads of birds that swarmed the Isle awakened her. She
arose, and knelt, and offered up her morning worship, then
came out of her chamber, and when she was joined by Madeline,
who with a bathing dress hung over arm, attended her
young lady down to the crystal creek, where for half an
hour she bathed and swan about like a Nereid in the limpid
stream. Then resuming her ordinary dress, she returned
to the house where Julius Luxmore would be waiting with
two horses to take her on her morning ride. After a
gallop of three-quarters of an hour around the beach, she
would return with a fine appetite for breakfast. After the
morning meal was over, she would retire to her own parlor,
the front room on the right hand of the passage on the first
floor, where she would occupy the long forenoon in reading,
drawing, and practicing music on the piano or guitar,
until one o’clock—when she would go out for an hour’s
walk in the shady groves before returning to dinner at
two. After the midday meal she would take her needle-work
and go into her uncle’s cool sitting-room, where she
would sit and sew, while the Monsieur Henri reclined in
his arm-chair, and Julius Luxmore read to them both from
Milton, Shakspeare, Paley, or some other of the English
poets or essayists, until the old man fell asleep. They
would then leave him to enjoy his nap, and go down to
the beach, enter the smack, hoist a sail, and take a run of
five or six miles up and down the Bay; after which they
would return to an early tea. When the evening repast
was over, Etoile would take her guitar and join her uncle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>and Julius Luxmore on the vine-shaded piazza, where
they would sit, and she would sing and play for them, until
the hour of retirement. At ten everybody on the Island was
in bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus I have given you as a sample one day of Etoile’s
life. A sufficiently happy programme for a single day;
but when day after day, week after week, and month after
month, with little variety, passed in this manner, it is not
surprising that it should become monotonous and wearisome,
and that, notwithstanding all the means and appliances
of happiness with which she was surrounded, the
beautiful Etoile should sigh for the unknown world beyond,
which her imagination painted in such brilliant hues.
And when Mr. Luxmore, after one of his visits to the
main land, would return, bringing some rare exotic, some
beautiful bird, some exquisite picture or sweet-toned lute,
she would receive them with a smile of joy and gratitude
that would be quickly followed by a deep sigh of aspiration
for that world beyond, whence all these beautiful
things came! For if every thing that came from that distant,
shore was so charming, how much more charming
must the shore itself be, she reasoned. And thus time and
circumstances increased her longing to see the mainland.</p>

<p class='c013'>But it was during the severe winter months when the
ice-bound shores of the island sequestrated its inhabitants
from all the rest of the human race, and allowed neither
going forth nor coming in, that the society of Julius Luxmore
was considered the very greatest acquisition to the
enjoyment of the family. During the short days, when
they could not venture from the house, Mr. Luxmore
would play chess or backgammon with the old man all the
morning; read to him and to Etoile all the afternoon, and
recount for their amusement his adventures by sea and
land, all the evening. Thus he rendered himself almost
indispensable to the house.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>It was in the fifth year of Julius Luxmore’s residence
upon the Island, that an important event occurred, which
shall be related in the next chapter.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The circumstance alluded to at the close of the last
chapter, was the death of Monsieur Henri De L’Ile.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was early in the autumn of the fifth year of Julius
Luxmore’s residence on the Island, that the old man
departed to the better land. His decease, as is frequently
the case with the extremely aged, was sudden and painless.
His death was as beautiful as his life had been beneficent.
And this was the manner of his falling asleep. Upon the
afternoon of the first of October, he had, in company with
his niece and his friend, partaken of a slight supper of coffee,
cakes, and fruit. He lingered awhile in the piazza,
listening to Etoile’s guitar. At the close of her song, he
smiled, laid his hand upon her bright curls, prayed God
bless her, and then calling his pet spaniel, he walked out
to his favorite arbor seat of late Bourbon roses, to sit
and watch the golden autumnal sun go down behind the
distant shore of Northumberland. He remained out so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>much longer than usual, that Madeleine went forth to seek
him.</p>

<p class='c013'>She found the old man sitting on the bench; leaning back
against the frame of the rose-wreathed arbor, seemingly
sleeping a sweet sleep. Not a feature of his fine old face
was disturbed, not a tress of his silvery hair disheveled. His
hands rested together on his lap; a blooming rose remained
in his relaxed fingers. His favorite spaniel lay at his feet,
quietly looking up into his calm face. His two white
pigeons were near—the one perched upon his shoulder,
cooing and pecking fondly at his cheek, the other flying in
playful circles around his head. Madeleine spoke to him
once—twice—thrice—and receiving no answer, took his
hand. The lingering rose fell to his feet; the hand, the
form, was icy cold. The loving spirit that had warmed it
for more than ninety years, had left it for a higher sphere.
Such had been his Euthanasy.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile wept vehemently over his death; but the tears of
youth are like morning dew or April showers—quickly
dried.</p>

<p class='c013'>He was buried quietly beneath a great old elm-tree near
the shore. By his own long previously expressed wish, no
marble tomb oppressed his body’s last sleeping-place.
Etoile would remember his grave, and the angel of the
resurrection would know where to find him; that was
enough, he had said.</p>

<p class='c013'>By his will, which he had executed during a lucid interval
at Heathville, where his monomania was unsuspected,
and which was duly opened the day after the funeral, it was
found that he had left the whole of his vast property to his
grand-niece, Etoile L’Orient, and appointed his good friend,
Mr. Julius Luxmore, the guardian of his heiress. Not a
single allusion to king, kingdom, or princess, betrayed
his partial insanity. A codicil to the same instrument
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>emancipated his faithful servant Madeleine, and her son
Frivole.</p>

<p class='c013'>This codicil, strange as the circumstance may at first
sight seem <em>pleased</em> Mr. Luxmore. He had always dreaded
the secret influence of Madeleine over her nursling, without
well knowing how to obviate it. Now, however, the way
was clear.</p>

<p class='c013'>And he informed the quadroon that herself and her son
being manumitted by their late master’s will, must forthwith
quit the Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>At first, poor Madeleine was dismayed. The mild service
of her master had been to her, protection, safety and
support. The shores of the Island had bounded her world.
She knew no other. To leave the Isle, to abandon her
young nursling!—freedom under such conditions struck her
as an overwhelming misfortune. She actually reversed
Catiline’s immortal speech, and exclaimed—“What’s set
free, but banished?” She tearfully represented to Mr.
Luxmore, her strong attachment to her home, and to her
young charge on the one hand, and on the other, her own
inexperience, her helplessness, and her dread of the world
of strangers.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Julius on his side described in glowing colors, the
“world beyond,” dwelling with enthusiasm upon the great
advantages it possessed for her own advancement, and
above all, for that of her beloved son Frivole. He also
fired the mind of the boy with a vehement desire to tread
those unknown shores. And between the eloquence of her
patron, and the importunity of her son, poor Madeleine became
resigned, if not reconciled to depart.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore also voluntarily promised to take the
mother and son to New York, and to procure for them
suitable employment.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Julius kept his word—being quite willing to put
himself to thus much inconvenience, for the sake of separating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>the nurse from her charge, and ingratiating himself
with Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>For, though the young creature sadly lamented the loss
of her “Maman,” yet having been persuaded by Mr. Luxmore,
that it was all for Madeleine’s good, she was not only
reconciled to her departure, but even grateful to him for
taking her away.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are going to the beautiful world beyond, Maman,”
she said, “and some day I, too, shall follow you.” And
unwilling to cloud the departure of her nurse with a single
complaint, the girl had heroically abstained from expressing
the keen regret she felt at losing her. When the sail that
wafted Madeleine and her son away, was lost to view,
Etoile abandoned herself to weeping for a while, but on recovering
she took herself to task, saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“How selfish I am to weep, because Maman has gone to
the beautiful world beyond! I ought to be glad, because
I myself wanted to go there so much.” And she repelled
grief as a sin of selfishness, and went and got her drawing
materials, and occupied herself with painting from memory
a portrait of “Maman.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore performed his promise, that is to say, he
conveyed the mother and son to New York, procured for
Madeleine the place of chambermaid, and for Frivole that
of waiter, in a third-class hotel, and abandoned them to
their fate. Now, whether this change of fortune was considered
“favorable” by the servants of the late Monsieur
Henri De L’Ile, remains an open question.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Luxmore returned early in November, bringing
many rare presents for Etoile, consisting of costly books
and pictures, an elegant paint-box, furnished with drawing
materials, model plaster casts and marble statuettes, an exquisitely
sweet-toned lute, and a collection of fine music.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was in Etoile’s boudoir that these attractive presents
were displayed to her delighted eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, how beautiful! how glorious! how heavenly! must
be that world, whence all these charming things come!”
she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore smiled at her hallucination.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! when shall I, too, see that lovely world?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When you are married, Etoile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When I am married,”—softly repeated this child of nature—“and
shall <em>I</em> ever be married?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, fair one.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And to whom shall I be married?” she inquired, looking
up in innocent surprise.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you not know then?” asked Julius Luxmore, gazing
wistfully into her eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, indeed, Mr. Luxmore, no one ever told me,” she
answered artlessly, without dropping her pure unconscious
eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thought you understood that you were destined to be
my bride.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>“Your bride? No, indeed, I did not know that before
Mr. Luxmore! Did uncle wish it?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly, my fair one. Besides, it is your interest.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I need no inducement to obey my dearest uncle, Mr.
Luxmore; but when are we to be married then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you in a hurry?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes!” answered the innocent creature with a deep
sigh of aspiration.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But why?” inquired Mr. Luxmore, curiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!” she replied, with another deep inspiration, “because
I do so <em>long</em> to go to the beautiful world beyond!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you wish to get married that you may go
thither?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! yes, indeed!” she said, clasping her hands fervently.
“When shall we be married, Mr. Luxmore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In some few months from this.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So long! Oh, Mr. Luxmore! why can it not be now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because, my lovely girl, you have not yet reached a
marriageable age.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what age is that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No matter, my dear, you have not reached it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, oh, Mr. Luxmore, how can you say that? I have
read in history, again and again, of princes and princesses
married in their cradles. There was the Princess Elizabeth
of Hungary, and the Prince of Thuringia, and many
others.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But they were princes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And am not I a princess?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my sweet! by virtue of your beauty, genius and
goodness, you are a princess; but in no other wise,” replied
Julius Luxmore, thinking that the time had now
come for this explanation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How, in no other wise?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore proceeded to explain to her that the Island
kingdom, king and princess, had been merely a pleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>phantasy on the part of her late uncle. Not for the world
would Mr. Luxmore have risked the danger that might
have grown out of his communicating to the young heiress
the fact that Monsieur Henri De L’Ile was of unsound
mind, and, consequently, legally incapacitated to execute
the instrument which constituted himself, Julius Luxmore,
the sole guardian of the young heiress and her large estate.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile received the news with less surprise than might
have been expected.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am satisfied now,” she said, “upon a point that for a
long time troubled me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what was that?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I used to pick out our Island in the map of the United
States, and I found that it was an adjunct to the State of
Maryland. Therefore, you see, I could not understand how
it should be a little kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you are not much disappointed to find that it is
not?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, no; on the contrary, I am glad to understand
clearly my real condition.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And yet, fair one, in some sense our beautiful Island is
really a kingdom, and we are its sovereigns.” Julius Luxmore
henceforth always spoke in the first person plural
thus associating himself with Etoile and her estate—it was
to accustom her to consider him as a joint proprietor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How then, Mr. Luxmore, since, our Isle”—(the simple
girl followed his lead in the use of the plural pronoun)—“is
not a kingdom in all respects, can it be a kingdom in
some senses? and how then are we in <em>any</em> sense sovereigns?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus, my sweet. Our Island is our undivided possession,
cut off from all the rest of the world——”</p>

<p class='c013'>——“The beautiful world!”—interrupted Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Over this insulated possession we have far more power
than a king has over his kingdom. We can let it, lease it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>sell it, or bequeath it to whomsoever we will! A king
cannot so dispose of his kingdom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, certainly not.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And then again, my fair one, we have more authority
over our people than a sovereign has over his subjects. We
can hire, sell, or bequeath any man, woman or child among
them to whomsoever we please. A sovereign cannot so
dispose of his subjects.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly not; but this superior power we possess
over ours, should only make us more mindful of our people’s
welfare and happiness.—So my dear uncle taught me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He was right,” said the wily Julius, “and that was the
reason why I took Madeleine and Frivole to New York,
where they will be so much better off.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh yes, you are so good,” replied the innocent creature.
And then she fell into a deep reverie, and wondered why it
was that <em>she</em> so often felt that Mr. Luxmore was <em>not</em> so
good as he seemed. And this fine insight she blamed as an
injustice; its suppression she regarded as insincerity; its
confession she seemed to consider almost a duty. Yet the
unwillingness to give pain restrained her communication;
she resolved silently to combat what she considered an uncharitable
feeling. And thus her natural instincts, which
might have saved her, were conquered as sins. After this
little struggle with herself, she spoke again.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To return to our first subject, Mr. Luxmore, why may
not I who am so nearly a princess, have the privilege of
one, why may I not marry now, and go to the beautiful
world beyond?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is there in the civilized world, another young girl so
unsophisticated as this sweet maiden?” said Julius Luxmore
to himself, as he met her pure clear blue eyes raised in innocent
inquiry to his face; he answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because, my sweet, not being really a princess, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>having a royal father to give you away, your marriage
would not be legal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The conversation here closed for the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore had formed the determination to spend
the winter in Paris. The beautiful Island was in summer
a delightful residence; but in winter, its ice-bound shore
was to this roving Sybarite the walls of a prison, while
distant Paris seemed to him a paradise of freedom and
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>But in order to leave Etoile with safety to his own interests,
there were many previous arrangements to be made.
It was now, as I have said, early in November. He wished
to sail for Paris about the first of December. The time
was short, and it was necessary to bestir himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>First of all, with a portion of the ready money left in
his trust for the heiress, he purchased a small wild farm,
some twenty miles inland from the Northumberland shore.
Then he drafted from the Island slaves every young and
middle-aged man, and several women, and sent them off to
“Black Thorns Farm,” his new purchase, where he placed
them under the care of a competent overseer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus there were left on the Island, only aged men and
women and children.</p>

<p class='c013'>For the service of the young heiress, he had selected an
honest, affectionate old negro woman called Moll, a hunchbacked
old man, misnamed Timon, and their granddaughter
Peggy. These were directed to take up their abode in
the mansion house, to supply the place of Madeleine and
Frivole and to protect and wait upon Etoile.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Her sweet song died, and a vague unrest,</div>
      <div class='line'>And a nameless longing filled her breast—</div>
      <div class='line'>A wish that she hardly dared to own,</div>
      <div class='line'>For something better than she had known.”—<cite>Whittier.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Not until all these arrangements had been completed did
Julius Luxmore announce to Etoile his intention of leaving
the Island to spend the winter in Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>The young creature looked dismayed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Mr. Luxmore, you will not go and leave me also!
My dear uncle is dead; Madeleine and Frivole have gone;
winter is at hand, when I cannot go out; you will not
leave me alone on the Island all these dreary months!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My sweet girl, I go at the call of duty. Besides you
will not be alone. There is still a gang of young women
and a force of old men on the Island, and in the house you
have Timon, Moll, and their granddaughter Peggy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know, and they are good creatures, and I will do all
I can to make them happy; but, Mr. Luxmore, I cannot
make companions of them,” replied the maiden, with a certain
mild majesty.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, my fair girl, you can seek companionship in your
books, your music, and your drawing. You can employ
these winter days in perfecting yourself in belles-lettres and
arts, and let me see when I return what progress you have
made; for, Etoile, with the earliest spring I will be here
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile smiled, but the smile was so sad that Julius Luxmore
hastened to say:</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>“You would not detain me here against my duty, would
you, my fair?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, oh no! it is selfish in me to repine. I will do so no
longer. Go, Mr. Luxmore, to the lovely, distant world;
but, come back to me with the flowers and birds of spring,”
said Etoile, and with a brighter smile she offered her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“With the earliest birds and flowers of spring, I will be
again beside my princess, and claim the hand of my promised
bride,” exclaimed Julius Luxmore, gallantly lifting the
tips of her fingers to his lips. Then, with a smile and bow
he left her, and went to make his final preparations for departure.</p>

<p class='c013'>From this day a man with telescope at hand was constantly
stationed on the look-out from the beach, to watch
for and hail the first up-bay vessel. For it was Julius Luxmore’s
intention to go to Baltimore, thence to New York,
whence he expected to find the earliest opportunity of sailing
for Havre.</p>

<p class='c013'>He held himself prepared to leave at half an hour’s
warning.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was at sunrise on a fine, clear morning, early in the
month, that the man on the look-out reported a sail bearing
up the bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore ordered him to exchange his telescope for
a speaking trumpet, and when she drew sufficiently near, to
hail her, to take on a passenger.</p>

<p class='c013'>The man obeyed, and the clipper came to anchor within
half a mile of the Island, and sent her long-boat ashore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore, all ready to depart, sent his trunks and
boxes on board the boat, and only waited for the appearance
of Etoile, to take leave of her before going.</p>

<p class='c013'>He knew that he had not to wait long.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, fresh, blooming, and beautiful as a rose, came
down from her morning toilet, and stood beside him on the
piazza.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>“You are going then, this morning, Mr. Luxmore?” she
asked, trying to smile and to speak cheerfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my fairest and best beloved; I am going. It is
duty that turns me from your side.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And duty must always be obeyed, I know,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore looked at her for a moment. He
seemed to realize with a strange thrill that the fascinating
creature beside him was no longer a child.</p>

<p class='c013'>He thought her, as she stood there, the most beautiful
creature that his eyes had ever beheld. Her dress of deep
black by the contrast of its shadow only threw out into
stronger light the dazzling clearness of her snowy skin, the
brilliant bloom of her cheeks and lips, and the sunny splendor
of her golden ringlets.</p>

<p class='c013'>He longed to clasp her to his heart and press a kiss upon
her rosy lips. But he durst not as yet. He never had
dared to embrace Etoile. For though in her unconscious
innocence she had freely promised to become his wife; and
though, as long as his endearments had been confined to
words, she had received them very quietly, yet he had
noticed that whenever he ventured to caress her, she shrank
as a sensitive plant shrinks at the slightest touch.</p>

<p class='c013'>Therefore he abstained from a parting embrace, lest he
should alarm her delicacy, and fatally repel her confidence.
And thus, alone, helpless, and in his power as she seemed,
his gentle and submissive ward, and his promised bride as
she was, her maiden modesty, and native dignity effectually
protected her from all undue familiarity on the part of Mr.
Julius Luxmore, until, as he promised himself, the law and
the church should place her irrevocably in his power.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The boat waits—I must tear myself away from you, my
own Etoile,” he said, taking her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>She gently withdrew it; but affectionately replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will go down to the beach with you, Mr. Luxmore.
Surely you do not think I would part with you on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>threshold of the house, when I might walk with you down
to the shore, and watch you even to the ship?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My darling girl, but it is so cold for my Etoile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I had prepared for the cold,” replied the child, beckoning
her sable maid, Peggy, and taking from her hands a
large fleecy white shawl, in which she wrapped her head and
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c013'>They then went down to the shore, where the boat
waited. The baggage was already stowed, and the sailors
were impatient.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Remember your promise to write every week, and to
send Timon to mail the letters at the Heathville post-office,”
said Mr. Luxmore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, you may be sure that I will never miss doing
so. It will be my best comfort,” replied Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And if you should ever be ill enough to need a physician’s
services, which is not at all likely, send for old Doctor
Crampton.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I will remember and obey you in all things, my
dear guardian.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, farewell, my beloved and beautiful Etoile,”—he
said, lifting her fair hands to his lips—“farewell for
the winter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, farewell for the <em>winter</em>; but with the first birds
and blossoms of spring you have promised to come back.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To claim the white hand of my beautiful bride,” replied
Mr. Luxmore, pressing her slender fingers. Then he relinquished
them and jumped into the boat, which was immediately
pushed off, and where he stood looking back and
waving his hat as long as he could see the fair Etoile lingering
on the shore.</p>

<hr class='c019'>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore’s voyage was rapid. Favored with a
fair wind, he soon reached Baltimore, whence he took the
cars to New York, where he arrived early upon the morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>of the day when the regular packet was to sail for Havre,
and in which he immediately took a berth. The passage
across the Atlantic was equally prosperous, and early in
the new year he found himself at Paris.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore’s immense wealth, or rather that of his
ward, which he freely appropriated, enabled him to enter
extensively into the English and American society of the
French metropolis.</p>

<p class='c013'>He contrived to get admission into an English Club, and
by his adroit maneuvering, he learned, for the first time, a
fact of the greatest importance to his plans; it was that of
the decision of the Court of Arches, recognizing the legality
of the marriage of Victoire L’Orient with the only daughter
of Sir Parke Morelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Julius Luxmore discovered with a thrill of joy, that
the beautiful Etoile was not only the actual owner of the
rich Island, but also the sole heiress of one of the wealthiest
estates in the West of England.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus, in birth and in fortune, as well as in beauty and
accomplishments, she was a match for a prince! But she
should never know it! He would guard her more jealously
than ever, and not until she had become his wife, should
he take her from the Island, present her to her aristocratic
relatives, or claim in her behalf the Island estate to which
the documents in his possession would enable him to establish
her right.</p>

<p class='c013'>And he longed with eager, vehement, passionate impatience
for the time to come that should secure to him the
possession of this peerless prize.</p>

<p class='c013'>He resolved that their marriage should be delayed no
longer than her sixteenth birthday, which would arrive the
ensuing midsummer. To pass the intervening time with as
little sense of tedium as possible, he plunged into all the
gayeties of the French capital. Then he made a short tour
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>through Italy. And finally, toward the spring, returned to
Paris, to collect <em>bijouterie</em> for Etoile, and to prepare for his
homeward voyage.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Etoile, left alone with her servants upon the Island,
found the time pass less heavily than she had dared to anticipate.</p>

<p class='c013'>The winter was less severe than usual. The atmosphere
was elastic and bracing, and the Island maiden was enabled
to pass part of every day in the open air.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her plan of self-improvement was conscientiously carried
out. The earlier hours of every day were devoted to a
course of reading. Finding herself wearied at about twelve
o’clock, she would put on a warm hood and sack, buckle on
her skates, and have an hour’s fine skating on the frozen
bosom of her own crystal creek. The first hours of the
afternoon she employed in practicing music, painting, or
embroidery. Growing tired of sitting, at about four o’clock
she would order her pony to the door, and spring into her
saddle for an hour’s gallop around her circular race-course.
Or if the weather confined her within doors, so that she
could neither skate at noon nor ride at sunset, she substituted
for both those recreations a visit to her sheltered birds
and flowers, that always afforded her ample entertainment.
The long winter evenings were employed in needle-work, or
in light reading. And upon some occasions, she would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>permit her two aged domestics to pass the evening in her
parlor, where she would entertain them by reading aloud
some interesting book, or else, while busily plying her needle,
she would listen to some wild and wonderful legend of ghost,
wizard or demon, related by some one or the other of the
old people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then she had the weekly excitement of receiving or answering
letters from her guardian, and the permanent interest
of anticipating his return.</p>

<p class='c013'>Thus her daily employments helped off the week, and the
weekly mail-day served to mark off the months, and hurry
forward the period for Mr. Luxmore’s return and her own
liberation.</p>

<p class='c013'>Her own liberation! That, at last, was the great object
of Etoile’s aspiration!</p>

<p class='c013'>So the winter wore away, and spring was at hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>About this time, having read all her books, learned all
her music, copied all her pictures, and worked embroideries
from all her patterns, and having no material of any sort to
labor upon, Etoile bethought herself of painting her own
miniature, as a present to her guardian. So one morning
she conveyed her drawing materials to her bed-room, arranged
them upon her toilet table, and seated herself before
the mirror, to commence operations. In three days, the
miniature was completed to her satisfaction. And an exquisite
face it was—a golden-haired, blue-eyed and rosy-cheeked
blonde, beautiful as an angel. Etoile was charmed
with her success; having completed the picture, she could
not leave it, but continued to play with the subject, by
changing the color of the drapery, first, from white to rose-color,
next to lilac, then to blue; then to black, and finally,
after sponging out the black, restoring it to its original
snow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, feeling at a loss what to do next, she resolved to
paint a miniature of herself with black hair, eyes and eyebrows,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>to see how she would look thus. She took her place
at the mirror, and went to work; and as she proceeded,
Pygmalion-like, she fell in love with her own creation. She
worked at it with enthusiasm; but as the picture grew
toward perfection, her artistic mind discovered that in contrast
with those darkest eyes and blackest ringlets, the
blonde complexion was too dazzlingly fair for harmony—that
she must put in darker and richer tints in the lights
and shadows of the face. The subject possessed for her a
strange spell of fascination. Under the force of powerful
inspiration, she perfected the picture.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, why, as she gazed upon her finished work, did
her heart swell with a strange trouble, her lips tremble, and
her eyes fill with tears? What was there in that beautiful
pale face, with its large, dark, mournful eyes, and falling vail
of shadowy ringlets, to attract her with such painful power?</p>

<p class='c013'>She had unconsciously drawn the likeness of her mother!</p>

<p class='c013'>She selected from her numerous trinkets a plain gold
locket, enclosed the miniature therein, and hung it around
her neck, wondering all the while, why she felt so strongly
inclined to wear this picture!</p>

<p class='c013'>She placed her own miniature in a similar locket, and
reserved it as a gift for her guardian, whose arrival might now
be soon expected. And at length, early in May, old Timon
brought from the post-office a letter announcing the speedy
advent of Mr. Luxmore.</p>

<p class='c013'>And from the day of the reception of the letter, Etoile
prepared all things to welcome with eclat her returning
guardian.</p>

<p class='c013'>And at last he came.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was high noon, and Etoile, dressed in a white muslin
gown and straw hat, stood upon the front piazza, about to
take her daily before-dinner walk, when one of the negroes
came running up the avenue toward the house, bringing the
intelligence that a vessel had come to anchor about three
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>miles out in the Bay, and that a boat put off from her side
was rapidly rowed toward the Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, with a cry of joy, hastened down the avenue toward
the landing-place, which she reached just as the long-boat,
containing Mr. Luxmore and all his baggage, rowed
by six sailors, was pushed upon the sands.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore sprang out and hastened toward Etoile.
The beautiful creature looked so attractive as she stood
there with her straw hat hanging on her arm, her snowy
drapery and golden ringlets floating on the breeze, that
Luxmore’s first impulse was to catch her to his bosom in a
warm embrace. But she arrested him, as with her innocent
child-like look of gladness she sprang forward, offering both
her hands, and exclaiming:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Welcome home, my dear guardian!”</p>

<p class='c013'>He caught her offered hands, pressed them, shook them
heartily, and lifted them to his lips, saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Etoile! my bride! how enchanted I am to be with
you again!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then leaving a command with the negroes to unlade the
boat, and convey the baggage to the house, he drew the
arm of his ward within his own, and they walked up the
avenue, homeward, both conversing—he with consummate
art, she with guileless simplicity. They reached the house,
and Mr. Luxmore retired to his chamber, to prepare for
dinner, which was soon served.</p>

<p class='c013'>The afternoon was spent in unpacking boxes, filled with
rich presents, which were displayed before the delighted
eyes of Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And these are all for my promised bride,” he said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, thank you! thank you!” exclaimed the maiden, in
sincere gratitude, as one beautiful article after another dazzled
her sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! how glorious must be the world beyond, whence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>all these wondrous beauties come,” she said, for perhaps
the hundredth time.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! come midsummer and your birthday, which is
also to be your wedding-day, and you shall see that ‘beautiful
world beyond.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>The artless creature responded by a radiant smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>The costly gifts were then all arranged in her own suite
of apartments.</p>

<p class='c013'>The evening was passed in the moonlit and vine-shaded
piazza, where Julius Luxmore related the events of his tour
in Italy and his life in Paris—or, at least, so much as was
proper for the hearing of Etoile, who listened with deep
interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now at last you are here!” she said. “You have
come back with the earliest birds, and flowers of spring,
even as you promised!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And I shall always keep my word to my beauteous
bride,” he answered, gallantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you find the Island in its very loveliest looks!
The Isle is never so charming as in May, when the grass
and the foliage wear their greenest and most delicate hue;
when the spring flowers are all in bloom, and the orchard
and groves are forests of blossoms; and the birds are singing
as they build their nests, or feed their young!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, it is all lovely! all charming! but the fairest
blooming flower and the sweetest singing bird of all, is my
own Etoile! my promised bride.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And yet to you, who come from the beautiful beyond,
this poor Isle cannot look so fair as it does to me who
never saw any thing brighter!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Luxmore smiled at her hallucination, and said to himself—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has <em>any</em> one <em>ever</em> seen any place brighter?” But while
he asked that question only in his heart, he replied to her
by his lips saying—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>“Come your wedding-day, and you shall see that beautiful
beyond!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And again the artless maiden responded by a smile of
innocent delight.</p>

<p class='c013'>So passed the first afternoon of Mr. Luxmore’s return.
And from that time to two weeks previous to their appointed
wedding, Julius Luxmore never left his betrothed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Five weeks passed away like a dream, and brought July.
Etoile knew that she was to be married on the fifteenth.
As it was necessary that Mr. Luxmore should visit the
main land to obtain the marriage license, the services of a
clergyman and a lawyer, and also the rich trousseau, including
the bridal vail and jewels, that had already been ordered
for Etoile, and as he wished to reach Baltimore in time to
join in the celebration of the great national festival, he informed
his betrothed that he should set out from the Isle
on the first of the month.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Three days to go to Baltimore, six to transact business
there, and three to return, bringing the attorney, the clergyman,
and the bridal regalia for my princess!” exclaimed
Mr. Luxmore, after detailing his plan to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, by the fifteenth of July, you will be with me again!”
she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye! and on the morning of the fifteenth we will be
married, and immediately after we shall sail for London,
where I shall present you to your English relatives.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“English relatives!” exclaimed the maiden, in astonishment—“have
I English relatives, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my love, did you not know it?” inquired the wily
Julius.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, of course not! I did not know I had a relative
in the world! You must have been aware that I was ignorant
of the existence of any kindred of mine,” she said, as
a feeling of cold distrust chilled her heart.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>“I supposed, my love, that you had heard of your mother’s
family.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, no!” exclaimed the maiden, in a voice of deep emotion.
“No one would ever tell me of my dear lost mother.
I have asked a thousand and a thousand times, but could
not learn who she was, or where she lived, or when she died.
It is so sorrowful to have never had a mother either living
or dead. For though I never saw my mother, if I only
knew the place where she sleeps her last sleep, I should
sometime go and water the turf with my tears. Mr. Luxmore,
can you tell me any thing about my mother?”—she
asked, clasping her hands, and fixing her eyes on his face
in the earnestness of her entreaty. “Oh, Mr. Luxmore,
please, can you inform me of any thing relating to my dear
mother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, nothing whatever, my sweet love.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of my mother’s relations, then? Has she sisters or
perhaps parents living, who would tell me all about her?—Oh,
<em>do</em> answer me, Mr. Luxmore!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My best love you shall go to England, see your relations,
and know all—after we are married.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“After we are married!—after we are married! <em>Why
must every thing be deferred until after we are married!</em>”
inquired Etoile of herself, as the same cold distrust chilled
her heart. But the next moment she reproached herself
for this incipient suspicion, saying mentally—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am unjust and ungenerous! My guardian must know
best! My guardian <em>must</em> be right.” And to atone for
her momentary doubt, she held out her hand and said submissively—</p>

<p class='c013'>“As you will, dear Mr. Luxmore. But—after we are
married, you will help me to find out all about my dear unknown
mother.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will, so help me Heaven, sweet Etoile!” he replied
lifting her hand to his lips.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>And the next morning, with a promise, wind and tide
favoring, to be back in two weeks, Julius Luxmore took a
tender and respectful leave of his affianced bride, went on
board a passing schooner, and sailed for Baltimore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile went to her room and wrote a letter to her nurse
Madeleine, in New York, informing her that her foster child
was to be married to Mr. Luxmore, on the fifteenth instant.
This letter was mailed at Heathville.</p>

    </div>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The time was the 15th of July. The place to which I
will introduce you was a narrow, two-storied, red brick
house, in a humble but decent alley, in one of the most
crowded neighborhoods of New York city.</p>

<p class='c013'>The street door opened immediately into a tiny parlor,
furnished in the simplest style.</p>

<p class='c013'>The walls were covered with paper of a light-grey pattern;
the floor laid with a grave Kidderminster carpet;
and the single front window draped with plain white muslin
curtains. Over the mantle-piece hung the portrait of a very
handsome man in the early prime of life. Each side of the
chimney the recesses were furnished with book-shelves, filled
with plain looking but standard volumes. On the opposite
side of the room sat a horse-hair sofa, while half a dozen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>reception chairs of the same material sat around the walls.
A guitar and a music-stand stood in one corner. A plain
mahogany centre-table occupied the middle of the floor.
Beside this was a large horse-hair lounging-chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reclining in the chair, with her elbow resting on the
table, and her head supported by her hand, sat a beautiful
woman of perhaps thirty years of age, clothed in deep
mourning. By the elegant form and graceful attitude; by
the clear cut, classic features, the delicate pallor of the complexion,
the slender-arched, jet-black eyebrows, the large,
languid dark eyes, with their sweeping length of lash, the
full and sweetly-curved lips, and the shadowy vail of falling
black ringlets, we might have recognized Estelle. Incurable
sorrow was still impressed upon her brow, occasional
sighs escaped her lips. This look of suffering had become
habitual, these frequent sighs were involuntary, unconscious,
yet they helped to relieve her oppressed bosom and keep
her heart from utterly breaking.</p>

<p class='c013'>On her lap lay a medical book that she had been studying
to enable her better to understand the case of a sick woman
whom, in her rounds of charity, she had lately discovered,
and whom she attended.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now the book lay idly open; with her elbow resting
on the table, her forehead bowed upon her palm, her dark
ringlets falling low around her lovely face, her dark eyes
fixed mournfully on the floor, her mind had gone far back
into the past, and was lost in reverie.</p>

<p class='c013'>The street door opened softly, and Susan Copsewood
entered the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>So deep was the reverie of Estelle, that she was unconscious
of the presence of her faithful maid. The lady did
not often weep, her grief was too deep and lasting for such
ephemeral relief. Yet now tear after tear gathered under
her drooping lashes, and rolled slowly down her cheeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan looked at her mistress, in deep sympathy, but did
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>not immediately address her. Isolation from all persons
of her own rank in life, and constant companionship with
her mistress, had refined and elevated the character of this
faithful girl, until she had become more the friend than the
servant of Estelle. And there seemed a fitness in this relation.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length the lady with a deep sigh wiped away her
tears, shook off her depression, and looked up. Her first
glance alighted upon Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, you are come, child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear lady,” answered the girl, but her looks and
tones were so full of surprise, uneasiness, and sympathy,
which she refrained in delicacy from otherwise expressing,
that her mistress, with a faint smile, answered her mute
appeal.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is nothing, Susan; at least, nothing new. This, you
know, is the birthday of my little child—my little child on
whom I was permitted to gaze but once, before my eyes
closed in insensibility, and her’s in death—my little child
whom I never saw but once in life, but whom I have seen a
thousand times in dreams! She would have been fifteen
years old to-day, Susan. Ah, if my little child had lived,
I should not to-day have been so desolate. Yet it is a
strange, sweet thought that I <em>have been</em> a mother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say that you are a mother, dear lady—the mother of
an angel who is fifteen years old to-day, in Heaven. A
mother never, never, never can lose her infant child, unless——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unless?”</p>

<p class='c013'>”——she loses her own soul, so that she cannot enter the
company of those who ‘are of the Kingdom of Heaven.’”</p>

<p class='c013'>“True, true!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then grieve no more to-day, dear lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will not, Susan. Indeed, I know it is very morbid to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>do so; and only on this anniversary do I shed a few tears
over her memory.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, give that habit up, dear lady; and weep no more
to-day, because your child is keeping her birthday in
Heaven.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because my Etoile is shining among her kindred stars!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your Etoile, dear madame?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Susan; that was her name. It was a girlish fancy
of mine, before her birth, in case she should prove a daughter,
to call her Etoile, because her family name was L’Orient,
and Etoile L’Orient, you know, Susan, by a free translation
means ‘Morning Star.’ She was my first-born, my only one,
my morning star—how quickly lost to mortal eyes in the
light of the eternal day! Enough of my star, now shining
among the celestial constellations! Tell me of my poor
patient, Susan, how is she?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madame, she is restless and moaning. She asks for
you continually.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then I must go to her immediately.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do wait until the cool of the evening, dear lady; it is
very hot this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, I cannot wait while a sick one is moaning for me.
Go up stairs and bring my things.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan went, and soon returned with the black lace bonnet,
thick vail, silk scarf, parasol, gloves, which was the
lady’s out-door dress. Estelle quickly arrayed herself, and
attended by Susan, soon left the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>A walk of half a mile through one of the most thronged
thoroughfares of New York, brought them to an ancient
street, into which “improvement” had not even peeped. It
was built up on either side with houses that had once been
tall, stately and aristocratic edifices, but were now old, dilapidated
and leaning dwellings, tenanted by the poorest
lodgers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before one of the most forlorn of these—a dingy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>tumbling, three-storied house, the lady and her attendant
paused.</p>

<p class='c013'>They entered the dirty door-way, passed up the hall, ascended
the stairs, turned to the right, and entered a poor
but clean, cool and shady room, where the walls were
well whitewashed, and the floor well sanded, the two front
windows darkened with slat blinds, and the air refreshed
with aromatic vinegar.</p>

<p class='c013'>On a cot near the centre of the room lay the sick woman.
A clean, white counterpane lightly covered her form. A
stand, with a pitcher of ice-water stood by her side.</p>

<p class='c013'>The woman was a quadroon of about forty-five years of
age, who had evidently once been very handsome, but whose
fine face was now worn down by sickness, want, and care.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a word, she was our old acquaintance, Madeleine,
whom nine months of city life, inexperience, and ill-luck had
reduced to this pass. Months previous to this, her son,
Frivole, had accepted a situation as traveling valet to a
young gentleman going to Europe. And after his departure,
Madeleine, disgusted with her life as chambermaid in a
large hotel, had left her place, taken a room, and commenced
business as laundress. Sickness had overtaken her,
in the midst of her labors, and reduced her to her present
condition. As yet, Estelle knew nothing of her except her
name and need. Only a week before, she had been told of
this subject of charity, had sought her out, found her in a
wretched bed in a filthy attic room, in this same house, abandoned
by all, and wasting with want and with a low fever.
As her condition would not permit her to be removed to any
distance, Estelle found a vacant room on the first floor,
front, had it thoroughly scoured and whitewashed, hung
those cool, dark green slat blinds to the windows, and put
in that cot, with a spring mattress and fresh, snowy draperies.
Then she had her patient laid in a bath, washed,
dressed in clean clothes, and removed to the apartment.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>And for the few days that had elapsed since her improved
circumstances, the woman had visibly amended.</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady now drew forward a chair and seated herself
beside her patient, took up a palm-leaf fan that lay upon
the counterpane, and began to fan the panting sufferer,
while she inquired in a gentle voice—</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you find yourself, this evening, Madeleine?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“More comfortable, but very weak, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is the very warm weather that enfeebles you, but we
shall soon have a thunder shower that will cool and purify
the air, and you will grow better.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On the contrary, my dear lady, I am sinking slowly but
surely.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You should not despond, Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not, my lady. I am sinking easily, easily, as a
tired baby dropping asleep on its mother’s bosom.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am nearly sure that you will recover, and see happier
days, Madeleine,” replied the lady, hopefully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Madam!” said the quadroon, fixing her glittering
eyes upon the face of her benefactress. “When you look
and speak so cheerfully, how the likeness does beam out!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What likeness, my poor Madeleine?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your likeness to my little nursling, dear lady. I never
did see such a strong likeness in all my life, although you
are so dark and she was so fair, and though you are always
so grave, and she was so gay. It is as if the same picture
were copied in light upon one plate and in shadow upon
another. And then you both have the same inflexion of
voice and turn of the eyes, though hers were blue as heaven
and yours are so dark. But I grow impertinent, dear lady.
Pray, forgive a poor woman’s garrulity. I make too free, I
know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, not so! You loved your little nursling very much
then.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>“Oh, I did!—I did, dear lady!” said Madeleine, covering
her face with her hands and beginning to weep.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madeleine—I was told that you wished particularly to
see me,” said Estelle, with the view of distracting her grief.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes Madam, it was for her sweet sake I wished to
see you this afternoon. Forgive me, dear lady, for troubling
you so much.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do not trouble me the least in the world. You
console me when you let me see that I can do you good.
Now tell me how I can serve you or your little nursling?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, I wished to pray you to write a letter for me
to my darling.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“This afternoon, Madeleine?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But you have too much fever to dictate it, Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, dear lady, never mind the fever in my veins if you
can make it convenient to write to her to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“All times are convenient to me, my poor Madeleine;
but why press the matter this afternoon, when you are so
feverish? Why not wait until to-morrow morning,
when you will feel more refreshed, Madeleine?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! how much you look like her now! But I must
write to her to-day, for this, dear lady, is her birthday.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Her birthday?” replied Estelle, feeling some interest
but not the slightest suspicion of the truth hidden in this
coincidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, dear lady, it is her birthday. And as she has no
mother or father to remember it for her, I must do so.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor child, she is an orphan, then?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lady, or rather worse than orphaned from her
birth. But then I always loved her as my own. She was
given into my sole care in her second summer, and never
was separated from me from that time until about nine
months ago. This is the first birthday she ever remembered
to have passed away from her Maman Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>“And how old is she now?” inquired the lady taking a
kind interest in her patient’s conversation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My little Etoile is fifteen years old to-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Ah!!</span>——”</p>

<p class='c013'>With this sharp and sudden cry, Estelle sprang forward,
her hands clenched together, the blood rushing in torrents
to her heart, her whole frame shaken by an inward storm;—and
then in an instant, she grew livid and sank back half,
fainting in her chair. The sudden revelation—the shock,
the truth, the joy had overwhelmed—had nearly killed her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan had heard and understood—Susan sprang to her
assistance, bathed her face with the ice-water, forced her to
swallow some, and held the sponge of aromatic vinegar to
her nostrils.</p>

<p class='c013'>She said to the sick woman, who had raised up in bed
and was gazing in surprise at this scene:</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a sudden pain to which my mistress is subject. Do
not be afraid—it will be over soon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, in fact, just then, Estelle lifting herself, put away the
offered assistance of her attendant, made a supreme effort,
and though still pale as a lily, and tremulous as an aspen,
she controlled her voice sufficiently to say in steady tones:</p>

<p class='c013'>“That will do, Susan. Sit down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And when her attendant withdrew from her side, and
took a seat at the foot of the cot, Estelle turned to the invalid
and quietly observed:</p>

<p class='c013'>“I fear, my poor Madeleine, that in your weak state my
sudden indisposition must have startled your nerves. But
you perceive that it is quite over with me now, so pray be
composed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, never mind me. I was only pained to see
you suffer.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Twas but for a moment; ’tis over now. Come, let us
talk of something else—your nursling——”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>“Dear lady, do not trouble yourself about the letter
now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, but I <em>prefer</em> to do it,” replied Estelle, and then,
anxious to hear repeated every particular, so as to have
confirmed that intelligence that seemed too joyful to be real,
she said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“You informed me that her name was——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Etoile L’Orient, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!—and her age?” demanded the mother breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fifteen years to-day, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! yes!—and you have had her in charge how
long?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“From the day when, at one year old, she was brought
from France to L’Orient Island, where I lived with my
master, her uncle, Monsieur Henri—I had charge of her
until last November.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is she now?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“On L’Orient Isle, where she has, since twelve months
old, resided.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And her parents?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never saw either of them. Her father, Monsieur Victoire
L’Orient, was lost on the Mercury. Her mother, an
English lady of rank, lived with her own family I believe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And the young girl, Etoile,—did she know, had she
ever been told any thing of her parents?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of her father, only that he was lost—of her mother,
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“‘Of her mother, nothing!’” repeated Estelle, in a tone
of anguish.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! it <em>was</em> bad, was it not, lady? But I was forbidden
to sadden her young heart by speaking of her lost
parents. And yet the innocent little heart was often sad
enough, especially for her unknown mother; and she used
sometimes to say to me—‘Ah! Madeleine, it is so sorrowful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>never to have known my mother, either living or dead.
I should have loved my mother so much, Madeleine!’ But,
my lady you are weeping!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! it is because I sympathize with your orphan
nursling, Madeleine. But go on—I think you said she
was beautiful?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As fair as a lily, as blooming as a rosebud, and as
graceful as a vine. She has heavenly blue eyes, and a halo
of golden ringlets around her lovely face.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And good? above all, is she good?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“As an angel, lady!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Beautiful and good! thank Heaven for that!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady, you weep, you turn pale and red, and tremble
and gasp for breath—what is all this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan! Susan! tell her.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Must I, lady?” asked the girl, coming up.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! yes!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The sick woman raised on her elbow and bent forward
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan took her mistress’s hand with the deepest respect
and turning toward Madeleine, said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady is the mother of Etoile L’Orient, your nursling.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good Heaven!” exclaimed the quadroon, sinking back
upon her pillow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then silence fell upon the three for a few minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>At length the lady said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madeleine, the letter you spoke of must be written this
evening; but first, do you feel quite equal to giving me a
short, succinct history of all you know, in regard to my
child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Quite equal to it, my lady! And not only that, but
so anxious to tell you, that if I did not do it, I should not
sleep a wink to-night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle arose and arranged the pillows more comfortably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>under the head of her patient; ordered Susan to get some
jelly from the basket she brought; fed the sick woman
with a few spoonsful; made her swallow a half glass of
lemonade; bathed her face and hands in perfumed ice
water; and when she saw her perfectly refreshed, she sat
down beside the bed, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, if you feel able, Madeleine, commence.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And the quadroon, beginning with the arrival of Madame
L’Orient with the yearling baby at the Island, related
the whole after history of the child, up to the time of the
sudden death of Monsieur Henri De L’Ile, the guardianship
of Mr. Luxmore over the heiress, and the emancipation
and departure of herself—Madeleine and her son
Frivole—from the Isle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you have not heard from her since?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh yes, my lady! After Mr. Luxmore went to France,
I received letters from the sweet creature almost every
month. She spoke of having written two letters previous
to that, but I had never received them!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And what sort of a man is this Mr. Luxmore, who is
left the guardian of my child?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady, he is about thirty-five years of age, handsome,
fair, accomplished, and seemingly amiable and upright—but——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, ‘but’ what?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Notwithstanding all that, I have no confidence in Mr.
Julius Luxmore!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot tell you, indeed, my lady, for I do not know.
Yet <em>he</em> perceived it, and for that reason banished me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“May not your want of confidence have been unjust?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Possibly, my lady; yet a circumstance has come to my
knowledge, which would seem to justify my instincts.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And that circumstance?” inquired Estelle, bending
eagerly forward.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>“In Mademoiselle Etoile’s last letter to me, dated six
weeks since, she tells me that she is to be united in marriage
to Mr. Julius Luxmore, her guardian, for that such
is his will.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Heaven of Heavens! No, no! I shall not so lose
my child! She is too young! She is but a babe! She cannot
love this man of thirty-five!” exclaimed the lady, half
rising in her strong excitement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I never said she loved him, Madame. Oh, in all affairs
relating to love, courtship and marriage, she is as innocent
as an infant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then he <em>dare</em> not coerce her! Isolated and helpless,
though she be, he <em>dare not</em> coerce her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady, he not only dare not, but he <em>will</em> not. It is
the <em>fortune</em>, and not the hand of this child that is the
object of his desire, I feel sure; therefore, he will use no
force that might afterward tend to invalidate his claim.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then since she loves him not, and since he dare not compel
her, I do not see how a marriage is to be brought
about?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah my lady! I told you she was as innocent as the
babe unborn of all knowledge relating to love and marriage.
She does not know that love is necessary both to the good
and happiness of marriage. She is ignorant but that matrimony
is a mere arrangement of convenience. And she
naturally takes her fate from her guardian, who is of course
interested in securing her large fortune and her beautiful
person to himself. And she, poor lamb, is even anxious that
this union should take place, that she may leave the Island
and go into the world. She sees the east and west shores
of the main land, only under the strong lights of the rising
and setting sun, and so believes that all glory and delight
is in what she calls ‘the beautiful world beyond!’ It
appeals that her guardian has promised to bring her to
this imaginary paradise, immediately after their marriage.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>“I see! I see the infamous motive under this! He
would give her no freedom of choice, until she is irrevocably
his own!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is just what occurred to me, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And when, does she say, that this atrocious marriage
is to be attempted?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Soon after her guardian’s return from France, for he
has not yet come, or at least, I have not yet received notice
of his arrival. And in fact I have not received a letter
from Etoile for nearly two months!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must save my child! I must go to her immediately.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh yes, dear lady, <em>do</em>! But how will you prove to
her your identity as her mother?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By nature first of all! <em>You</em> did not doubt me, although
no blood of mine runs in your veins. Still less will <em>she</em>
hesitate, who is altogether my own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But for the satisfaction of others, dear lady; though
you and Etoile may be perfectly certain of your relationship,
how will you prove to others that you are her mother,
she your daughter, and so establish your right of authority
over her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thus. By documents no doubt to be found in the
Island Mansion, which will prove that Etoile is the child
of Victoire L’Orient and his wife, Estelle Morelle. And
by Susan here, and a thousand others, if needful, that I
myself am that very Estelle Morelle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far, so good.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, tell me, how am I to reach this Island; for it is
my intention to hire a nurse to take care of you, and to
proceed at once in search of my child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, thank you, my lady, you are all goodness; but do
not stop to find me a nurse.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must do as I see fit in that respect, Madeleine; that
is not the question now; but how I shall reach the Island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My lady, I cannot tell. For years past no one has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>arrived at the Island except Mr. Luxmore, and he came in
his own schooner.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then tell me at least what is the position of this Island
in the Bay?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot tell you, exactly; but it is within two or three
hours’ sail of a point called Brande’s Headland.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Brande’s Headland!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, my lady! You know the place?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Somewhat.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was always my late master’s favorite point of communication
with the shore. I believe also that there is
always a sail-boat at the place, under the charge of the
negroes. And I think perhaps your quickest and surest
way of reaching the Isle would be to go to the Headland
and hire a boat from there.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“So I believe. I now know what to do. And now,
Madeleine, for the letter that we must write.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The requisite materials were found in the drawer of the
little stand, the top of which, when cleared, served as a
writing-table.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dictate now, Madeleine, as you would have done had
my relationship to your nursling never become known to
you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The quadroon looked surprised at this order; but with
perfect confidence in her patroness she obeyed.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was just such an affectionate letter of congratulation
as any nurse might have written to her beloved child on
her birthday. And in the postscript was added, by the
lady’s wish, merely these words—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>I have news of your mother!</em>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is sufficient; we must not overwhelm the child;
we must communicate only enough to prepare her for my
coming,” said Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the letter was sealed and duly directed, it was
given in charge of an honest lad, the son of a poor widow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>living in the same house, who was called up to carry it to
the post-office.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And be sure, my boy, to inquire if there is a letter for
Madeleine Rose,” said the sick woman, as the lad left her
side.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It has been so long since I have heard from Etoile,
that I think there <em>must</em> be a letter in the office,” she added.</p>

<p class='c013'>As there was much to do in a little time, the lady had
her attendant arose to take leave.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall endeavor to send you a nurse this evening, Madeleine.
And if you should get a letter from Etoile, will
you send the lad to No. 5 —— Lane, and let me know?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed I will, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They now took leave and departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>On reaching the street door the overcast appearance of
the western sky struck them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am afraid there is going to be a dreadful storm, my
lady. Look what a black cloud!” said Susan.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! we shall have a tempest. I knew, by the state
of the atmosphere, that we must have one before long.
And it is coming. But, Susan, we have a great deal to do,
and storm or calm, we must do it this afternoon; for I propose
to sail in the very first vessel that leaves this port for
the Chesapeake, even though there should be one going to-morrow
morning. So, in order to save time we must take
a cab.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And as an empty carriage was just then passing, Susan
stopped, and engaged it for the remainder of the afternoon.</p>

<p class='c013'>When mistress and maid were seated within, the first
order given was—</p>

<p class='c013'>“To the Infirmary Intelligence Office.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A drive of ten minutes brought them to the place,
where Estelle was so fortunate as to engage a well-recommended,
middle-aged woman, who, being paid in advance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>agreed to go at once to the sick room of Madeleine. They
next drove to the nearest upholsterer, and sent a new cot,
mattress, and bedding for the accommodation of the nurse.</p>

<p class='c013'>They then purchased all the day’s newspapers, and gave
the order—</p>

<p class='c013'>“No. 5 —— Lane.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And in half an hour they were at home.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were no sooner in the little parlor than Susan
struck a light, relieved her mistress of her outside garments,
and carefully ensconced her in her easy chair. Then
placing a lighted lamp and the pile of newspapers on the
table beside her, she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, my lady, while you look at the ship news, I
will hurry into the kitchen and have your tea ready in a
moment.”</p>

<p class='c013'>She hastened to the adjoining little back room, leaving
her mistress opening the papers.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle turned at once to the list of vessels “to sail,” ran
her eye eagerly down the column, and then exclaimed,
reading aloud—</p>

<p class='c013'>“For Baltimore, on the 17th of July, the fast-sailing
brig Ocean Queen, Brande Master.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is my old friend Barbara, whom I desire, but dread
to meet! Yet she could serve me in this cause better than
another. Shall I go with her? Let destiny decide! If I
can find another vessel going to the Chesapeake to-morrow,
or the next day, that is to say at or before her time of sailing,
I will go by such an one. If I cannot, I will sail with
Barbara; for I have said that I will certainly go by the
first craft that leaves.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then addressing herself again to the list, she went carefully
down the column. And afterward she successively
consulted the ship news in all the remaining papers, but
without finding any other vessel that was to sail for the
Chesapeake for days to come.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>“Indubitably I go with Barbara,” concluded the lady, as
she folded up and put away the last paper.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan then opened the door and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Supper is served, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle went out into the little back room, and seated
herself at the neat table. But her spirits were too much
hurried to permit her to do justice to the fragrant tea and
nicely-browned toast that Susan had prepared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan scarcely observed that her cookery was slighted.
The storm that had been gathering all the afternoon was
now about to burst upon the earth and sea, to the mortal
peril of all, great and small, that floated upon the one or
stood upon the other. And Susan was flying about, closing
shutters, and letting down windows, for the better preservation
of their own tiny homestead. Scarcely was the
last fastening secured before there blazed forth a blinding
flash of lightning, followed instantaneously by a deafening
crash of thunder, that seemed to shake the whole heavens
and earth into dissolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan, arrested half way across the floor, turned deadly
pale, and grasped the nearest chair for support.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come into the parlor,” said Estelle, rising from her
almost untasted meal.</p>

<p class='c013'>They immediately went into the front room; Estelle sat
down in her easy chair; Susan, who was dreadfully afraid
in storms, dropped down at her mistress’s feet, and buried
her face in her mistress’s lap.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then for six hours, there raged one of the most terrific
tempests in the memory of the present generation.
From seven, <span class='fss'>P.M.</span>, till one <span class='fss'>A.M.</span>, wind, hail, thunder and
lightning, made night hideous with their strife.</p>

<p class='c013'>Unprecedented desolation marked the progress of the
storm on shore. Trees were twisted off at their trunks, or
torn up by the roots; groves, gardens and growing crops
were devastated. In the towns and cities, old buildings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>that had stood the storms of centuries, as well as new edifices
in process of erection, were alike leveled to the ground.
Creeks and rivers, swollen to enormous size, overran their
banks, flooding the whole shore, and sweeping off vegetation,
buildings, cattle, men, women and children. The sea
arose in its awful might, and advanced upon the land, desolating
many towns and villages along the coast.</p>

<p class='c013'>Great as was the devastation of the storm upon the land,
those who were competent to judge, prevised a far greater
mischief to the ships at sea. And those who had relatives
or friends afloat, waited in extreme anxiety to hear news of
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>The six dreadful hours were passed by Estelle and her
attendant in prayer to Heaven for all those who were exposed
to the horrors of the storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>At one o’clock the phrenzy of the tempest began to subside
as the passion of an infuriated madman might, in sullen
howls, and sometimes returns of frantic violence. And by
two o’clock, the thunder and lightning had ceased, the sky
was marbled over with troops of black, dispersing clouds,
like a disbanded army of storm fiends, and the moon shone
out, clear, bright and benignant, as some fair angel speaking
peace to the world.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan lifted her head from the lap of her mistress, where
all this time it had lain, and arose from her kneeling posture.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle also stood up and bade her attendant prepare for
retiring. Evening prayers were said. And thanks were
returned to Heaven for the calm that had succeeded the
storm. Then, unsuspicious of the great damage that had
been done by land and sea, the mistress and the maid cheerfully
sought their beds.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle slept in the front room over the parlor. Susan
occupied the back room over the kitchen. The door of
communication was always open between the chambers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>Thus Susan, whose mind had been too thoroughly excited
by the events of the day, to admit the possibility of her
composing herself to rest, knew also that her mistress did
not sleep for an instant; but turned, and turned in her bed,
and sometimes arose softly and paced the floor. Hoping
that the lady would at length lie down and sleep, and fearing
to confirm her wakefulness by addressing her, Susan
refrained from speaking or moving until some time after
daybreak.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, seeing that her mistress opened the blinds to admit
the daylight, and proceeded to make her morning toilet,
Susan quietly arose and passed into her room.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dear girl, go back to bed. I did not wish to disturb
you so soon after your loss of rest. Go to sleep
again,” said Estelle, as soon as she perceived her attendant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As if I <em>could</em> sleep again! Dear lady of mine, <em>you</em>
have not slept all night! no, not for an instant. Why?”
inquired the girl, with affectionate solicitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle turned and came up to her humble friend, laid her
hand upon the girl’s shoulder, and with her eyes, her lips,
her whole eloquent countenance beaming with a tender
gladness, said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Susan, many, many nights in my life have you
known me to lie awake, from eve to morn, from <em>sorrow</em>.
But never, in the whole course of my existence, Susan, have
I lost but this one night’s rest from joy! Oh, Susan, think
of my not being able to sleep for joy! My Etoile! my own
child, whom I have mourned for so many years as dead!
To think that she lives! that I shall soon clasp her living
form to my bosom! It grows upon me, this sense of joy,
Susan! it overpowers me! Oh, pray Heaven, that I, who
cannot sleep for gladness, may not become unable to reason
because of ecstasy!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“God bless you and preserve you, in joy as in sorrow my
lady!” prayed her faithful attendant.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>Alas! short-lived joy!</p>

<p class='c013'>Scarcely had the words of self-congratulation left the lips
of the mistress, and been answered by those of fervent sympathy
from the maid, ere the door-bell was rung.</p>

<p class='c013'>Susan hastened her toilet, and, wondering who it could
be who came so early in the morning, went down to open
the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was Jerry, the lad whom they had sent to the post-office
on the preceding evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Please ma’am, will you ask Mrs. Estel to come directly
to Madeleine, who has got a letter to show you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“A letter from whom?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“She told me to say from the young lady on the Island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good news, or bad?” asked Susan, breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She didn’t tell me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well; run home as fast as you can, and tell Madeleine
that my mistress will be with her immediately.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lad obeyed, and Susan ran up stairs to inform her
mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You needn’t tell me. I have heard all, Susan! Quick!
my bonnet and gloves!” exclaimed Estelle, who with trembling
fingers was fastening her black silk mantilla.</p>

<p class='c013'>And in less than five minutes the mistress and maid set
out for Madeleine’s lodgings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I should have sent for you last night, but for the dreadful
storm,” said Madeleine, as the lady took a seat beside
her bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the letter, Madeleine? the letter! What news?
How is she?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Madam, but——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what? Speak!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It seems that another letter has miscarried, since she
says that she wrote me about six weeks since, advising me
of the fact of her guardian’s return.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has returned!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>“Yes, Madam—and—lady, it appears from her letter,
dated ten days ago, that her guardian had gone to Baltimore
to make preparations for their marriage, but was
expected home yesterday, which was to have been their
wedding-day.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no, no, no! Great Heaven, no! It cannot be that
this innocent girl should be left to fall a sacrifice to that
creature’s cupidity! Surely something has intervened to
save her! The steamboats have brought us news of many
vessels becalmed at sea, in the great stillness of the atmosphere
that prevailed until the storm of last night. He may
not yet have been able to reach the Island!” exclaimed
Estelle, vehemently, catching at the merest possibilities, as
the drowning catch at sea-weed.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Or—he may never reach it. He may have been wrecked.
Many vessels must have been lost in the tempest,” suggested
Madeleine.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, Heaven forbid! But the great calm that preceded
the storm must have stopped him. In the tempest of last
night, he had enough to do to save his vessel: he could
have made no progress. This morning something may have
happened to detain him. I shall sail to-morrow in the
Ocean Queen, the first vessel that leaves this port, for the
Chesapeake. I may yet be able to save my child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven grant it, madam!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Read the letter now—nay, give it to me, if you have
no objection.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Madeleine took the precious missive from under her pillow,
and handed it to the lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>Eagerly Estelle opened it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Artless, affectionate, and full of enthusiasm, was this
child’s epistle. She wrote of her approaching marriage
with the most innocent frankness, treating it as a necessary
preliminary to her heart’s greatest aspiration, to see “the
beautiful world beyond.” She continued by saying that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>making the bridal tour, they should come first of all to New
York, where they should take the steamer to Liverpool, and
where also she should be so happy to rejoin her dear Maman
Madeleine, whom she intended to take with her as her attendant
to Europe. She concluded with the fondest expressions
of attachment and the tenderest epithets of endearment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The unsophisticated girl! Oh, Heaven grant that I
may be in time to save her!” prayed Estelle, as she folded
the letter.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime, Susan had been in consultation with the nurse
who quickly prepared a cup of tea and a slice of toast for
the lady, who had not as yet breakfasted.</p>

<p class='c013'>The errand-boy, Jerry, was dispatched to call a carriage.
While he was absent, both mistress and maid partook of
some slight refreshment, and soon afterward entered the cab
and drove down to the —— street wharf, off which lay the
Ocean Queen at anchor.</p>

      <div class='line'>To see you here before me.”—<cite>Shakspeare.</cite></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The brig lay some quarter of a mile off the shore. Susan
hailed a skiff, which soon put herself and her mistress alongside
the vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande’s deck, as usual, presented an animating
scene of orderly industry. Edwy, as mate, had charge of
the forecastle. Several men were aloft, at work upon the
rigging. Others were at the hatches, getting freight into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>the hold. Barbara stood upon the quarter-deck, directing
some men, who were lowering the long-boat to go on shore
Upon observing a lady coming over the gangway, she
quickly walked forward to welcome the visitor. Barbara
was the same handsome Amazon; with the same erect and
rounded form, the same stately head, firm features, great,
strong, flashing black eyes and brilliant complexion, shaded
by crisp, rippled bands of glittering, jet-black hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mrs. Estel! By all that is best, Mrs. Estel! Welcome,
welcome, welcome! I am so overjoyed to see you!”
she exclaimed, extending both hands to her visitor.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Am I so little changed, Miss Brande, as to be recognized
at once?” inquired the lady, with a slight smile, as
she clasped the offered hands of the girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Changed?” repeated Barbara, looking affectionately
into her face. “Yes, my lady, you are changed somewhat—a
little paler and thinner, which makes your eyes look
still larger and darker by the contrast; that is all. I knew
you, of course, at a glance. Ah, Susan, is that you? <em>You</em>
are not changed the least in life. How are you? But
come into the cabin where we can talk; for oh, my lady, I
think that we must have a great deal to say to each other,”
exclaimed Barbara, addressing sometimes one and sometimes
the other of her visitors, as she led the way into the cabin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“First of all, Miss Brande, I wish to inquire it myself
and maid can have berths here?” asked Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Of course,” replied Barbara, promptly, as she motioned
her visitors to take seats upon the sofa, at the same time
placing herself in a chair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then consider them engaged at once.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are going to Baltimore or Washington?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“To neither. We are going back to the Headland, unless
you can engage to put me on shore upon East Island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>East Island!</span>”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes; why are you astonished, Miss Brande?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>“Because no one ever lands on East Island. It is, in
fact, inaccessible at all points save one. Besides, the old
man who owns it is as jealous as a Chinaman of the approach
of strangers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But the old man has been dead nearly a twelvemonth.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The old man dead!—and I never knew it!—though,
in fact, everybody on the Island might die, and the rest of
the world would know nothing about it. And so he is
gone! Well, ’tis said that</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c004'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The angels weep, when a babe is born,</div>
      <div class='line'>And sing when an old man dies.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>But what has become of the pretty heiress, Etoile?” inquired
Barbara, at heart wondering how it was that Mrs.
Estel should know any thing of the Isle and its inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The young girl remains there under the charge of her
guardian, Mr. Julius Luxmore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara heard! She heard this name pronounced without
an exclamation, a start, or a change of color, betraying
how terrible was the shock she had received—so perfect was
the nervous system, and so admirable was the self-command
of this noble girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was scarcely a perceptible change in her voice, as
she repeated—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Julius Luxmore? You said that the young lady’s
guardian was Mr. Julius Luxmore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Miss Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“May you not be mistaken in the name, madam?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Impossible, Miss Brande. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, I knew Monsieur Henri De L’Ile for many years,
and never heard him mention such a person among his intimate
acquaintances. Though it is true that Monsieur
Henri, who never encouraged visitors to approach the Island,
some years ago even discontinued his visits to the mainland;
or else, changed his trade from our shore to the opposite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>one, so that, for the last five years, I have lost sight of
Monsieur De L’lle.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And it was precisely for that length of time, only, that
he had been acquainted with Mr. Luxmore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then it is not strange that I should never have heard
of that friendship,” said Barbara, too calmly to betray how
much she was impressed by this new coincidence.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, Miss Brande, I have made a discovery, which I wish
to impart to you. But first, will you permit Susan to close
the cabin?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara arose and secured the door, and returning, said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now I am at your service, dear lady. Go on: I listen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande, this man, this Julius Luxmore, has for
five years past, fixed his avaricious eyes upon the fortune
of his ward, and to secure that, has determined to take advantage
of her innocence and inexperience, and, child as
she is, to marry her. But, if it should not be too late, I
have power, through the discovery that I have made, to
prevent this sacrifice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You, my lady?” replied Barbara, who neither by look,
tone, or gesture, revealed how deeply the iron entered her
soul.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I, Miss Brande! And hence my intended voyage
to the Island. But I must tell you the momentous discovery
that I have made. You may remember that, in
relating my story, I informed you that after the birth of my
little girl, I just saw her face fade away from my fainting
eyes; and that after recovering from the alternate stupor
and delirium of many weeks, upon inquiring for my child,
I was told that she was dead and buried?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I remember, lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>I was deceived.</em> My child was not dead. She had
been secreted by her grandmother, Madame L’Orient, who
after the transportation of Monsieur Victoire, to make herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>acceptable to the childless Monsieur Henri, conveyed
the infant to the Island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, madam, what a discovery! To what providential
circumstance were you indebted for it?” inquired Barbara,
who, through all her own aching heart, sympathized with
this deeply-wronged mother.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To a providential meeting and conversation with her
nurse, Madeleine, whom the jealousy and caution of Mr.
Luxmore had banished from the Island,” replied the lady,
who thereupon commenced and gave a full and detailed account
of the manner in which she had become acquainted
with Madeleine, and the revelation which had been made
her by the latter, concerning the infancy of Etoile, the
death of Monsieur Henri, the guardianship of Mr. Luxmore,
and the appointed marriage between the guardian
and his ward.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Barbara listened—no outward emotions revealing
the inward storm that shook her great soul. That her betrothed—whom
she had mourned as dead, these five years
past, and to whose memory she had been more faithful than
many widows to that of their husbands—should have been
for this length of time, not dead, but deliberately false—false
under circumstances that increased a thousand-fold
the heinous enormity of his treachery—was a thought that
convulsed her soul with anguish. But there existed a merciful
possibility that this might not be <em>her</em> Julius Luxmore!
True, the name was rare, the coincidences striking, the circumstantial
evidence nearly overwhelming; but she had
heard of innocent people being convicted upon much
stronger proof; and she would suspend her judgment until
her own eyes should convince her of his turpitude! But,
until then, what a war in her bosom! Happily, with her
regnant self-control, she let no sign of this inward tempest
escape. She answered Estelle very calmly, saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, lady, you are right. If not too late, this unnatural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>marriage must be stopped. And if not too late <em>now</em>,
lest it should become so by another day’s delay, we must
lose no time. It was my intention to sail to-morrow morning
for the Chesapeake. But if you wish, and if you will
be ready, I will get up anchor and make sail for the Island
at moonrise this evening.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! how generous you are! how heart and soul you
enter into my interests, Miss Brande—dearest Barbara!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay, call me by my Christian name, I like that best,”
was all the answer the quiet, but half broken-hearted girl
made.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle and her maid then arose and took leave of Miss
Brande, promising to be on board an hour before the time
of sailing, in the evening.</p>

<p class='c013'>For some moments after her friends had left the vessel,
Barbara Brande remained standing, like one transfixed by
sorrow and dismay. Then, suddenly starting, she exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“But this is no time to think of my own trouble. I must
bring <em>them</em> together!”</p>

<p class='c013'>And she hastened down into her cabin, where she took a
seat at her little table, drew writing materials before her,
and indited the following brief letter—</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in8'><em>Brig Ocean Queen</em>,</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'><span class='sc'>My Lord</span>:—We sail for the Chesapeake this evening.
If you would hear of one for whom you have long searched,
meet me at the Headland, where I shall wait for you.</p>

  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>B. B.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>She sealed the letter and superscribed it—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘The Right Honorable, the Earl of Eagletower,</div>
      <div class='line in20'>Washington, D. C.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Then, calling Edwy, she bade him take the letter, and
hasten with it ashore, to secure the next mail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile the skiff, still waiting alongside, conveyed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>Estelle and her maid to the wharf where they entered the
cab and returned home to make hasty preparations for their
voyage. They packed up a few articles of wearing apparel,
closed up the house, called to take a hasty leave of
Madeleine, drove down to the wharf, and by seven o’clock
found themselves in the stern gallery of the Ocean Queen.</p>

<p class='c013'>At eight o’clock, the full moon arose, a light breeze from
the west sprang up, and under these favorable auspices the
brig made sail.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If this weather continues, we shall reach the Island in
five days,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven grant that it may so,” replied Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Unlikely, as under the most favorable circumstances, it
seems, I still have a deep prophetic feeling that I shall yet
be able to save my child!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven grant <em>that</em>, also,” said Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Amen,” responded Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>And then, as the friends sat in the stern gallery, watching
the receding shores, or the moonlit sea, their thoughts
reverted to by-gone days.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do not see Willful! What have you done with my
favorite?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Willful has been midshipman in the navy for three
years past, dear lady; his ship is now daily expected home
from the Mediterranean.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am glad to hear it,” replied Estelle, and then after a
short pause, she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am thinking of Joseph in Egypt, when he lifted up
his voice, and said—‘I am Joseph. Doth my father yet
live?’ Oh, Barbara, you know what I would ask! Do <em>my</em>
parents yet live?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady, when I last heard of Sir Parke and Lady Morelle,
some few months since, they were enjoying their usual
health, and living in their customary state, at Hyde Hall.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>“Thank heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But, Madam, is there no one else that you care to inquire
for?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! Tell me, Miss Brande, if you can, that <em>he</em> is well
and happy. That he has forgotten poor Estelle, and all the
sorrows she has occasioned him, and has found, somewhere,
a bride to his mind?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady, is it possible that you never look into an English
newspaper?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never. If they fell in my way, I might not be able to
refrain from searching them, any more than I can refrain
from questioning you. But they have <em>not</em> come in my way,
and I have abstained from seeking them. But tell me of
<em>him</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady, he has regularly corresponded with me, for the
last five years. Each month he has written, asking me if
I have heard news of <em>you</em>. And when I last heard of <em>Lord
Montressor</em>,”—she said, laying a strong emphasis on the
name—“he was resident minister at the court of ——. Lady,
both your parents and your lover have sought you
over the earth, for five years past. Immediately after
the decision of the Arches Court, which you might have
seen——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, I saw it by chance, in the Court Journal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>——“Your father and lover set out for the Headland,
where they arrived just a month after you had left. I cannot
describe to you their disappointment. It was deplorable!
Since that they have used every means to discover
your retreat. How vainly, you know.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande, I shall trust in you to keep my secret!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Dear lady, I really will not enter into any bonds of that
sort. You must trust solely to Providence for your future.
I think if you knew how rare a thing is constancy, in this
world of ours, you would set more value upon that of the
Earl—I mean Lord Montressor.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>Estelle made no reply to that, but turned the conversation
into another channel.</p>

<p class='c013'>They remained talking until ten o’clock, when Estelle
retired to her state-room, and soon after to her berth, where,
exhausted by the fatigue and excitement of the last two days,
she soon fell into a deep sleep.</p>

<p class='c013'>Alas! for the fair hopes with which this voyage commenced!
The next day the weather changed, the wind
shifted, and blew straight ahead for three days, during which
the vessel beat about, making little or no progress down the
Atlantic. And when at last the gale subsided, there ensued
a dead calm, that lasted two weeks, during which the vessel
lay like a log, burning under the fierce heat of the July sun.
Barbara and her passengers were nearly in despair. But we
must leave them in their dilemma, and borrowing the wings
of imagination, precede them to the Island, to ascertain
what, in the meantime, has been the fate of Estelle’s child.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>No band of hired minstrels sounding their reveille, aroused
Etoile L’Orient on the morning of her birthday and appointed
bridal eve. But the matin songs of myriad birds
that made the fair Isle their home, as usual awoke the
maiden.</p>

<p class='c013'>With no understanding of the dreadful, loveless, life-long
bond, with which she was about to fetter her soul—but with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>an ecstatic recollection that upon this day, it was appointed
she should leave the Isle for the unknown world beyond, the
artless creature sprang from her couch, to greet the sun
upon this her bridal morn.</p>

<p class='c013'>She went first and threw open the window-shutters to
look out.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a morning without cloud or mist, or breath of
stirring air. Far eastward, across the still gray waters and
beyond the silvery sanded flats of Accomac, the sun—like a
king without his court—was rising in solitary grandeur; not
a single courtier cloud attended his levee, or reflected his
splendor. Every aspect of the earth, sea and sky, foreboded
a still, close, hot day, to be followed by a night of storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every solitary dweller with nature is by habit weatherwise.
Etoile, the young recluse of the Island, could read
the signs of the sky, and looking out, breathed a light sigh.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The atmosphere is lifeless, though ’tis early morning;
not a leaf stirs on the trees; scarcely a ripple curls on the
waters; even the birds have already ceased their songs;
and I—I can scarcely breathe this motionless air! But I
will ask Moll about the weather, she knows the best.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And going to the bell-rope, the young girl rang for her
attendant.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Moll and little Peggy entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What sort of day is this going to be, Aunt Moll?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed, Miss Etty, it gwine be like yisdy and day ’fore
yisdy, on’y more so! ’Deed it’s wonderful hot an’ close;
not a bref of air more’n de whole yeth had de asthmetics!
Marster send a little gus’ or somefin to freshen the air a
bit! Is yer gwine down to the crik?” said the old woman,
as she busied herself with getting together her young lady’s
bathing dress, shoes, cap, towels and so forth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes,” Etoile said, “of course I am going down to the
creek.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Timon always waited at the little maiden’s solitary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>breakfast table. This morning he made his appearance just
as his young mistress took her seat at the board.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What sort of weather are we going to have, Timon?”
asked the child.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Honey, dere’s bound to be a change afore long,” replied
this philosopher, oracularly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What <em>sort</em> of a change, Timon?” inquired Etoile, a little
impatiently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“A <em>change</em>—dat all I kin say,” responded the sable savan,
growing more profoundly mysterious.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think that the packet will reach here this morning?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, honey, dat is ef she kin git here! which you see
’pends ’pon circumferences b’yond our ’trol.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Finding that there was no satisfaction to be got from
Timon, the young lady arose and retired to her own parlor
and endeavored to settle herself to her usual avocation. In
vain! She could not confine her attention to the open
book before her. She tried her painting, and then her
music, with no better success. Finally, she arose and went
to her aviary.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Poor little captives! you are so like myself that I ought
not to neglect you for an hour,” she said, and calling her
little hand-maid, Peggy, to her assistance, she opened all
the windows of the aviary to let in more light if not more
air. And then she busied herself until noon in cleaning out
the cages, and supplying them with seed and water and
fresh green boughs. The clock struck twelve while she was
still at work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Noon! and the packet not here yet! Bring me the
telescope, Peggy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The little maid obeyed. And Etoile taking the instrument
from her hand, went out upon the piazza, adjusted the
glass, and took a sweeping survey of the Chesapeake. Up
the Bay, in the direction whence she expected the packet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>with Mr. Luxmore, not a sail was to be seen. Down the
Bay—very far down, midway between the two capes, lay,
apparently becalmed, a vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>With a deep sigh, she lowered the telescope, laid it on
the settee, and returned to her occupation in the aviary.</p>

<p class='c013'>At dinner she again spoke to Timon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Two o’clock, uncle, and the packet not here!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How she gwine be here, chile, widout a bref of win’ to
blow her along?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I wish the wind would rise!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Hush, honey! you don’t know what yer asking for!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, but I am <em>so tired</em> of this place.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You wants to leab we-dem mighty bad!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! no! no! only for a little while! I could not
desert the dear Isle, and you all who are on it, forever, because,
after all, I love my Island and my people better than
all else <em>living</em>. But I do not want to go and see the wonderful
world. And even more than that, I want to see my
dear lost mother’s friends and hear about <em>her</em>. For you
know, no one would ever tell me about my dear mother—where
she lived, or if she lived at all!—or if she was dead,
or where she was buried! So, you see, I am left altogether
in doubt. And Mr. Luxmore has promised to take me,
directly after we are married, back to my mother’s friends.
It is that which makes me so anxious to be gone! Oh,
Heaven! that the wind would rise!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Leaving the table, she called Peggy to bring her the
telescope, and went up stairs to the attic, and then up the
ladder to the little observatory terrace upon the apex of
the roof between the two central chimneys. Adjusting the
instrument, she looked far up the Bay. There was not a
sail to be seen. She turned the glass down the Bay. There
lay the schooner just within the Capes.</p>

<p class='c013'>While watching her still white sails, she observed the
ragged end of an inky cloud just above the horizon. At
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>the same instant, a distant, deep, and hollow moan sounded
over the sea, and like a prophetic sigh from nature, the first
breath of the waking breeze touched her brow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank Heaven, the wind is rising,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>And lowering her telescope, she went below.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Timon, the wind is getting up! the packet will be in!”
she said exultingly to the old man, whom she found upon
the piazza.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, honey; but dis win’ come <em>up</em> de Bay dead ag’in
any down packet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, so it is! I never thought of that,” said Etoile,
with a look of disappointment.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But don’t you git ’scouraged, honey! Now de win’ up,
it may shif’, an’ any win’ short ob <em>harrycane</em> is better nor a
dead calm.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Restlessly, impatiently, the girl walked about, looking
first from one window and then from another. At last she
said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bring along the telescope, and go down to the beach
with me, Timon. I want to watch.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And taking down her straw hat, she tied it on and led the
way to the extreme south point of the Island, called The
Shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>This was the most desolate—or rather the <em>only</em> desolate
portion of her insular domain. In low water, it exhibited
several acres of rugged shoal, consisting of reefs beyond
reefs of sand, shells, sea ore, and all the multifarious deposits
of the waves. Here, after ebb tide, in the deep pools left in
the hollows between the reefs, shell-fish were caught in
abundance by the Island negroes. Now, the water was
very low, and Etoile could easily step across the little pools
in which she observed the crabs and manenosies struggling to
escape.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give me the glass! There! stand and let me rest it
upon your shoulder, good Timon, and I will see what I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>see. That schooner is nearer. Her sails are filling with
the breeze. She is bearing up,” said Etoile, after she had
taken sight. Then lowering the glass, and returning it to
the keeping of Timon, she scanned the sky with her naked
eye. Detached and ragged fragments of an inky cloud,
sailed like an ill-omened fleet before the wind up the horizon.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There will be a gust! I hope it will not be a serious
one. What think you, father Timon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“’Deed, honey, you may ’pare for any thing, when you sees
de debil’s black rag-bag shook out in the sky dat way!”
said Timon, ominously.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wind blew higher—the fleet of clouds sailed up
faster—the sea took on a darker shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Etty, chile, I think how we done better go into
the house,” said the old negro, uneasily.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Perhaps we had,” said Etoile, turning. “But, father
Timon, what is the matter with the birds?” she inquired,
calling his attention to the great flocks of water-fowl screaming,
that darted distractedly to and fro between the darkened
heavens and the troubled sea, or dropped in sudden terror
to the covert of some thicket on the Island. “What does
ail the birds, father Timon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Dey</em> knows,—de dumb creatures do!” replied the old man,
mysteriously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean, father Timon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! chile, you’s young—you is! You nebber see such
a tempes’ in your life, as we-dem gwine to have to-night!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I hope not! Dear Heaven, I hope not!” exclaimed
Etoile fervently, and the next moment she took heart of
grace, and comforted herself with the reflection that old
Timon was always at best a croaker.</p>

<p class='c013'>The gale was now blowing so hard, that it was with difficulty
she could keep her footing, and avoid being thrown
forward upon her face.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>As they neared the house, she saw old Moll and Peggy
hastily closing blinds and letting down windows.</p>

<p class='c013'>Turning her eyes over the grounds, she noticed the old
men hurrying the frightened cattle into their places of
shelter, while crowds of women and children were running
toward the mansion house, as a place of greater safety from
the impending storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>Flocks of sea-fowl were seen settling on the Isle. Man
and beast, alike, seemed impressed with the prophetic instinct,
that the coming tempest would be one of unprecedented
violence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Old Moll opened the front door to admit her young
mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come in, chile! Lors a messy ’pon top o’ me! Come
in out’n the win’! It’s enough to blow you ’way!” she
said, taking the hand of the young girl, and drawing her
within the door. Then noticing the crowd of women and
children, increased now by the arrival of the old men from
putting the cattle up, she angrily exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c013'>“What all you-dem black niggers come a scrowdging in
here for? Go ’long wid yer! You tink how ef de debbil
want you to-night, Miss Etwil can save you? Go ’long wid
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, let them come in, poor souls! if they think they will
feel any better here! We will all sit together in the large,
front room, until the storm is past,” said the gentle-hearted
girl. And, as her sweet will was law, all her people entered
with her, and found shelter in that spacious apartment opposite
Etoile’s parlor, which had once been Monsieur Henri’s
hall of state.</p>

<p class='c013'>The negroes withdrew to the walls of the rooms.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Find seats—find seats—you must not, after your long
day’s labor, remain standing,” said their kind young mistress.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old people sat down in chairs, at a humble distance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>from their little lady, and took the children upon their laps.
The others seated themselves upon the carpet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile drew a chair to the centre-table, and reclined.</p>

<p class='c013'>They were scarcely thus arranged, when a vivid flash of
lightning, followed by a tremendous roll of thunder, startled
every one to their feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marster, messy on us!” cried old Moll, crossing herself.
“Oh, Miss Etwil, honey, let me light a bless’ candle!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You must trust in the Lord, mother Moll.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, chile, so I does; but I’d feel heap easier in my
mind, if there was a bless’ candle-light.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, yes, Miss Etwil! please, honey, let the bress candle
be lit,” pleaded the other servants.</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no wisdom in arguing with terrified negroes in
a storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Light the candles, if you like,” said the little lady.</p>

<p class='c013'>Moll jumped to avail herself of the permission. She went
to the fire-place, where, occupying the centre of the mantelshelf,
stood a plaster image of a saint, with a wax candle in
each hand. Moll took one of these, drew a match and
lighted it, and was just about to replace it in the hand of
the image, when—</p>

<p class='c013'>There fell—hurled down from heaven—a tremendous
thunderbolt, striking and shattering the chimney, throwing
Moll upon her face, extinguishing the candle, and stunning,
into momentary insensibility, every person in the apartment.</p>

<p class='c013'>Total darkness and silence followed the shock.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, who, in the swift instant of receiving the electric
charge had believed herself to be annihilated, was the first
to recover her senses and presence of mind. More slowly
returned her powers of speech and motion. But all was
total darkness and stillness around her. She listened.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not a motion—not a breath—not a sound—save the falling
of the rain, was heard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Father! are they all killed?” she exclaimed. “Who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>is alive? Is there no one that can answer me?” she inquired
and waited for the issue.</p>

<p class='c013'>None spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>She arose, still quivering from the shock, and groped her
way over prostrate forms to the mantle-piece, when she felt
for the matches, and lighted the remaining candle. The
illumination of the room showed her the forms of the prostrate
negroes, slowly recovering, and amid muttered prayers
and exclamations of dismay, picking themselves up.</p>

<p class='c013'>No one was hurt.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile stooped and took up the extinguished candle,
lighted it, and placed it, with the other, in the hands of the
image. The double light certainly made the large room
look more cheerful, and revived the spirits of the appalled
negroes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But see you,” said their young mistress, “you must trust
in God alone. For observe, even though Aunt Moll held
the blessed candle in her hand, she was struck down by the
shock of the thunderbolt, and the candle was extinguished.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lord forgive you, Miss Etwill, honey,” replied the old
woman. “It wur de bressed an’ holy candle as saved all
our lives. An’ ef’ I hadn’d had de sanctify candle lighted
in my han’ when I was struck, I done been stretch out here,
a dead ’oman on de floor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile’s blue eyes dilated at this strange but almost unanswerable
argument, and before she found a reply, another
blinding flash of lightning, followed by an appalling crash
of thunder, and a dashing flood of rain, sent all the negroes
upon their knees.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile grew pale as death, not for herself, but for others.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, God have mercy! Oh, God guard the ships at
sea!” she prayed, with clasped hands, and lifted eyes.</p>

<p class='c013'>“An on we-dem, too, amen, amen,” responded all around
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now in the intervals between the rolling, crushing,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>and rending peals of thunder, and in the pauses of the
dashing floods of rain, and the howling blasts of wind, was
heard another dread sound.</p>

<p class='c013'>It came not—like the thunder, the rain, and the wind—in
fitful and startling assaults.</p>

<p class='c013'>It came at certain intervals—regular, monotonous, and
inexorable as fate.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a slow succession of dull, heavy, tremendous
shocks, at each of which the solid earth seemed to quake
and shudder.</p>

<p class='c013'>Each shock was nearer, harder, heavier than the last.</p>

<p class='c013'>The negroes heard it in appalled silence.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our young heroine listened to the unknown sound, and
looked upon the panic-stricken faces of her people. Then
she inquired with forced calmness—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is that noise, Timon?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Miss Etwill, honey, don’t ax me! Say your prayers,
chile, an’ let’s die like Christians.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, God, it is the <span class='fss'>SEA</span>! The <span class='fss'>SEA</span> is advancing upon
the Island!” exclaimed Etoile, as the awful truth broke
upon her consciousness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then followed weeping and wailing, and wild wringing
of the hands among her servants.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, heroic by nature, and self-controlled by education,
after her first exclamation, became composed. Her clear,
strong, active intellect at once comprehended the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The house stands high, the walls are of solid masonry.
The sea may enter and flood the lower chambers, but will
not be likely to rise to the upper ones, and cannot sweep
away the building,” she said to herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>But, meanwhile, the wild tumultuous waters thundered
onward like a vast besieging army. Soon the strong walls
shook under the cannonading of the waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>The negroes howled in the very agony of terror.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>“Silence, and listen to me!” exclaimed the young heroine
rising and lifting her hand to attract attention.</p>

<p class='c013'>In an instant the lamentations ceased, and all looked up
to her beautiful inspired face, as though it had been the
face of an angel.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To the attic chambers! Every one of you to the attic!
There you will be quite safe.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But so benumbed were their faculties by fright, and so
confused their senses—with the mingled, deafening, chaotic
noises of rolling thunder, and howling wind, and falling
trees, and, above all, of the dreadful roar of the waters that
broke against the trembling walls and creaking doors and
windows of the house—that they seemed to have lost the
power of motion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“To the attic! to the attic, for your lives! Snatch up
the children and fly!” exclaimed Etoile, just as a great sea,
thundering, broke upon the walls, and bearing down the
doors and windows, rushed roaring into the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>They had had barely time to seize the children and run
through the back door to the back staircase, up which they
fled before the pursuing waves.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, who had lingered behind to see that none were
left, must have been whelmed in the black rush of waters
that soon filled the first floor, but for her power of swimming.
So she reached the staircase, and clambered up.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three flights of stairs brought her to the attic, where she
found her terrified people gathered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We are safe! we are safe! Return thanks to God and
set yourselves at rest,” exclaimed their mistress, as she
joined them.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, young missus, is you sure?” inquired one of the old
women.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, the water has risen only to the fifth step on the
first staircase—it is wonderful that it could rise so high, and
nearly impossible that it should rise higher. Be all composed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>Give thanks to God, who holds the sea in the hollow
of his hands. Who says unto the wild waters, ‘Thus
far, no further shalt thou go; and here let thy proud waves
be stayed.’ The storm must be nearly expended. It is
almost midnight. And midnight and noonday, like sunset
and sunrise, are always crises in weather,” said the young
girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>But nothing seemed to corroborate her comforting testimony.
For in this lofty, bleak, exposed attic, the violence
of the storm was fearfully apparent. Through the uncovered
glass windows, the lightning blazed in a continuous
and blinding glare. Over the near roof, the thunder broke
in deafening crashes. Around the peaked gables, the wind
raved, rifting off and rattling down the shingles. And
through every chink and crevice the rain poured; while up
from below, rose the roar of the multitudinous devouring
waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was a night of such fear, horror, and desolation, as the
oldest negro on that Island had never seen before.</p>

<p class='c013'>At one o’clock, while the storm was still raging, Etoile
crept down in the dark, to take observation of how high
the waters might have risen in the house. Down two flights
she went, and paused at the head of the third. It was pitch
dark. She stopped and listened, and heard the muffled motion
of the waters within the walls, but was unable, from the
sound, to judge how near they might be to her feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Never mind. I will hold by the bannisters and step
cautiously, and when I wet my shoes, it will be time enough
to stop,” said the heroic girl, as she went down on her dark
and dangerous exploration. She had descended to the turn
in the staircase, and had not yet wet her feet, when by the
red gleam of the wax-lights left burning high in the hands
of the image on the marble shelf of the large room, she
saw the dark pool of waters below. Now, it may be strange,
but it is true, that this still, black, confined abyss of water
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>in an unwonted place, filled her soul with more fear than
the great waves of the open sea could have inspired, because
mingling with this fear was a disgust and loathing which
could make no part of the terrors of the great ocean. Nevertheless,
she went down nearly to the dark water’s edge, and
by the red gleam of the candle-light upon the surface, she
noticed that it had fallen to the third step and was steadily
subsiding. Having ascertained this fact, she hastened back
up stairs to rejoice the hearts of her people with these glad
tidings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The sea is receding. In an hour it will have retired
from the house. <em>Now</em> will you return thanks to the Lord
who has stayed the waves?” she exclaimed, as she joined
her people.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! we do, we do, Miss Etwill, but hear to the thunder
still!” responded old Moll on the part of the negroes.</p>

<p class='c013'>The storm, however, had spent its worst fury.</p>

<p class='c013'>The wind, like the waves, was subsiding.</p>

<p class='c013'>The flashes of lightning were less vivid, and less frequent.
The peals of thunder rolled off faint and far.</p>

<p class='c013'>The rain fell softer.</p>

<p class='c013'>After two o’clock the clouds began to break away, dispersed.
And at three o’clock the same placid morn that
had shone upon Estelle, lying awake in her small dwelling
in the distant city, looked in now through the attic window,
upon her fair child, Etoile, seated among her sable
attendants.</p>

<p class='c013'>As soon as the thunder and lightning had ceased, the
negroes, a heavy-headed race, had one by one dropped
asleep on the attic floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>But not so could Etoile compose herself to slumber. The
novelty and excitement of her position, suspense and anxiety
concerning the fate of the vessels at sea, combined to
banish sleep from her eyelids.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>Near morning she went to one of the front dormer
windows, opened it and looked out.</p>

<p class='c013'>The far-spent night was now almost as light as day. The
full moon rode in the mid heavens. The first faint dawn of
morning paled the east. A few rent and ragged black
clouds hung about the horizon, only serving to make the
gray sky look lighter by the contrast. The sea had receded
from the centre of the Island, but still raged and boiled
over two thirds of the lower portion. Many fragments of
broken timber were tossed hither and thither upon the
crests of the waves. At first Etoile naturally supposed these
to be portions of the Island cabins carried away by the
flood.</p>

<p class='c013'>But the next instant, raising her eyes and looking out at
sea, she saw, oh horror! what?</p>

<p class='c013'>The bare hulk of a vessel, the masts and shrouds all gone,
tossed about, the sport of the maddened sea!</p>

<p class='c013'>And while her eyes were still spell-bound to the awful
spectacle—the wreck shuddered through all her frame, settled,
and went down, and the waves closed over the spot
where she had sunk!</p>

<p class='c013'>With a terrible cry, Etoile fell upon her face. Neither
her cry nor fall aroused any of the heavy-headed negroes,
sleeping the deep sleep of exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c013'>Not long the poor girl lay in her swoon; for when she
recovered her senses it was early morning. At first stupefied,
bewildered and confused, with a dull, aching, undefined
consciousness of something painful lying heavy at her heart,
she strove in vain for recollection. And then suddenly
flashed back upon her mind the perfect memory of the night
of storm, and the ship that sank in her sight.</p>

<p class='c013'>She hastened to arouse her servants.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Awake! awake! up! up! a ship has been cast away
on our shoal! I saw her go down before my eyes!” she
cried, shaking one and then another. In a few minutes all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>were on their feet, and eagerly questioning each other as to
what has happened.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Etoile rushed to the window and looked out. The
sun was just rising.</p>

<p class='c006'>The sun arose over a scene of wild devastation. The
green and blooming Isle was laid waste. Rose trellises,
fences, arbors, and even the cottage homes of the negroes
had been swept off by the flood. Groves of old forest trees
had been torn up or broken down. Orchards of young
fruit-trees were uprooted and swept away. Growing crops
were annihilated. The sea that had receded from the Isle,
surged, boiled and plunged madly upon the beach. A wild,
sullen, and chaotic sky overhung the scene. Black, torn
and jagged clouds, looking as though by some violent concussion
of the elements they had been shivered into fragments,
still hung about the horizon. The receding winds
and waves still moaned in fitful gusts. “‘Our house is left
unto us desolate,’” said old Moll, speaking in the solemn
words of Scripture, as she looked forth upon this scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But indeed I do not mind that! for a few months of
patient labor and another spring will repair all the damage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>done to the Island. But for the lives lost! Oh, friends, for
the lives lost upon that doomed vessel, and upon how many
more—good Heaven!—that may have gone down in the
storm of last night!” said Etoile, mournfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Our cabins are all carried away,” muttered one old
woman disconsolately.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your cabins shall be rebuilt and refurnished. All your
losses shall be repaired. But alas! for those who have
perished. Who shall rebuild their house of life?” she added
sorrowfully. Then solemnly replying to her own question,
she said: “Even the Lord of life! He shall rebuild
their house of life! He shall give them mansions in the
sky.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, after a little pause, she suddenly exclaimed:
“Come, friends, let us go down and learn the worst.” And
she led the way, followed by the whole troop.</p>

<p class='c013'>The third and the second floor of the house were found
uninjured. But the first floor that had been swept by the
flood, was thoroughly saturated with wet, and covered with
a thick deposit of sand. The water-mark upon the walls
showed that the sea had risen to the height of four feet in
the rooms. All the lighter articles of furniture, such as
chairs, footstools, etc., had been floated off. Other things
remained uninjured.</p>

<p class='c013'>They quickly opened all the doors and windows, to let
the drying air pass through, and then they went forth from
the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>So rapidly had the sea advanced and receded, that the
ground was not wet many inches deep. And they were
enabled to pass, if not dry-shod, yet without wading, down
to the beach, called The Shells.</p>

<p class='c013'>Here was a wild scene! The higher sites of the shoals
were littered with fragments of the wreck—broken spars,
planks, casks, coops, etc. Further down the stormy sea
still leaped, plunged, and broke upon the shore. While
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>carefully picking her way among the multifarious fragments
of the wreck, and springing over the surging pools, from
rift to rift, Etoile suddenly paused and shrieked.</p>

<p class='c013'>At her feet, among broken boxes, staved barrels, and
tangled ropes,—bound with sea-weed, and half buried in
sand, lay the body of a young man!</p>

<p class='c013'>In an instant, Etoile was kneeling by his side, sweeping
the sand and sea-weed from his face and form, and eagerly
searching for some sign of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, come Moll! come Timon! come all of you and tell
me! Is he dead? Is he dead?”</p>

<p class='c013'>With an interest almost as intense as though the stranger
had been some near friend or relative, she cleared his face
from obstruction, loosened his cravat, and sought to raise
his head.</p>

<p class='c013'>But at that moment a spasm of pain convulsed his face
and a tremulous moan escaped his lips. “Oh! he lives!
the poor youth lives!” she exclaimed, rising and addressing
the old negroes, whose slow steps had now brought them to
the spot.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Peggy! you and Chloe run, and bring down hither the
light wicker settee from the hall, and spread two soft quilts
upon it, girls. He must be laid upon that and carried up
to the house. Timon! as soon as ever the sea subsides
sufficiently to permit it, you must take the cutter, and run
across to Heathville, to bring Doctor Crampton here. He
is very much hurt, I fear! Oh girls, make haste! It is so
dreadful for a bruised or wounded man to lie here on these
rugged rifts!” she exclaimed, giving all her orders with a
clearness and promptitude worthy of an older head.</p>

<p class='c013'>As soon as it was possible to accomplish the task, the
young negro maids returned, bringing the settee and soft
quilts, which were folded and laid upon it.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now raise him tenderly, tenderly. Timon, help them.
Softly—do not jar his form. Ah! he moans! you hurt his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>shoulders, Timon! Be very careful. Now ease him down
on the settee—so—there,” she said, hovering with compassionate
interest around the wounded man, while her troop
of attendants looked on stupidly, or lent their aid only at
her command. In truth, the poor creatures had not yet
recovered from the panic of the storm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, Peggy and Chloe, take the head, and, Anne and
Jane, go to the feet, and so go on, slowly to the house.
Be careful! do not stumble! The least roughness of motion
must be so painful to a wounded man. Aunt Moll, you and
Aunt Patsy, hurry on to the house, and prepare your old
master’s chamber and bed for this youth,” said Etoile, anxiously
heedful of the welfare of the human waif thus cast
upon her care.</p>

<p class='c013'>She was promptly obeyed in every particular. And while
the old negro men remained upon the shoals, searching with
the instinct of natural wreckers, for spoils among the fragments,
the old women, with a kinder impulse, hastened as
fast as age and the rough way would allow, to prepare for
the comfort of this survivor of the wreck. The young
maids bore their burden gently on; and Etoile walked by
the side of the settee, anxiously watching the pale, haggard,
but handsome face of the sufferer.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very carefully he was carried into the house, and up into
the chamber of the late Monsieur Henri.</p>

<p class='c013'>Very tenderly, then, the two old women changed his
clothes, and laid him on the bed, covering him with a light,
soft, white counterpane. When this was done, they called
their young mistress, who came in with a small crystal flask
of brandy, and a little glass.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have been looking in a medical book. It says that
brandy must be given. Lift his head gently, Moll, while I
pour a little into his lips,” she said, approaching the bed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The woman complied; but the lips, or rather the teeth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>the patient were so firmly closed, that she could not force a
drop through.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Moll, I shall have to bleed him!” she said, almost in
tears.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Bleed! you! Miss Etoile? You do such a thing?”
exclaimed old Moll in dismay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes! the book says in such a case as this, it must be
done. There is no one here to do it but me. I know how
it should be done, for I have often seen my dear uncle do
it, in cases of necessity. Oh, I feel it is dreadful. It makes
my blood run cold to think of it; but sooner than see a
fellow-creature die, you know, why, even I must nerve myself
to use a lancet.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And, without further ado, the young heroine prepared
bandages and bowl, selected from her late uncle’s case of
instruments a proper lancet; and then, having stripped the
arm to the shoulder, and tied a handkerchief tightly around
it above the elbow, until the vein was erected, she took the
blade between her finger and thumb, and with a firm hand
proceeded to make the incision. It is true, that her sweet
young face was pale as marble, and her lips firmly compressed,
as she watched the thick and crimson stream of life
curl slowly over the white arm; but her courage was repaid
when, presently, she saw the rigor of the patient’s form and
face relax, and his bosom rise and fall in a long, deep, soft
breath.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Thank Heaven! Oh, thank Heaven!” she said, as she
unbound the tight ligature to let the tide of life flow back,
and carefully bandaged the arm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, fair and gentle lady,” she heard a faint
voice murmur, and looking up, as she replaced the arm, she
saw the dark eyes of her patient opened, and regarding her
with an expression of mingled astonishment and gratitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>She beckoned her old servant to take away the sanguinary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>evidences of her late work, and then stooping, inquired
softly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Are you hurt much?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think not, young lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Try to make a very deep breath,—so, there,—does it
hurt you to breathe thus?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not in the least, my kind nurse.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then that proves that you have received no injury!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay! thank Heaven, I have received no inward hurt.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now move your limbs. Can you move them freely and
without pain?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, young lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is certain, then, that they are not broken nor
strained.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ay! thank Heaven for that, also,” said the patient
smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive me, if I seem intrusive; but I am the only
doctor that is at hand, just now. So, for your own sake,
young gentleman, you will be so good as not to mock when
I question you,” said the young girl, with the mild majesty
that, on occasions, she could assume.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am most indebted to your compassion, my fair physician.
I am blessed beyond my merits in falling into your
hands. Did my smile offend you? Ah, young lady! it
was the smile of one not fully come to his senses! Did
you know how little cause I have to smile, you would pity,
even more than you condemn.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I condemn not! I pity from my deepest heart. But
think of yourself, and of getting better. You have friends
who love you, and for whose sake you must strive quickly
to recover. Now then! move your arms, please.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The patient obeyed, but groaned deeply with the effort.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One of your arms is hurt?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I think it is broken above the elbow.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>It was a sudden catching of the breath, so full of acute,
sympathetic pain, that the sufferer looked up in the pale face
of his young nurse, wondering that this sensitive creature
could be the same girl who, ten minutes before, had nerved
her gentle heart to use the lancet.</p>

<p class='c013'>But even while he wondered, she was gone from the
room.</p>

<p class='c013'>In two minutes she was back again, with Moll bringing
a little pail and some napkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>“My name, lady, is Willful Brande, midshipman in the
United States’ service,” said the youth, who thought the
time had come when politeness required him to announce
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! you are the Brande of the Headland. And, indeed,
I saw a resemblance to Miss Barbara Brande,” said
Etoile smiling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is my only sister.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I saw her only once; but I liked her very much; I am
glad if I can be of service to her brother, for her sake,”
said the young girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And not for his own?” was upon the lips of the youth
to ask; but respect and delicacy restrained the question.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you on the part of my sister as well as of myself,
young lady,” he answered.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>My</em> name is Etoile L’Orient,” replied the maiden,
blushing, she knew not why, under the eloquent look of
gratitude he had raised to her face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I shall never forget that name in my prayers, sweet
lady,” said the youth.</p>

<p class='c013'>And now with slightly tremulous fingers, having confined
the last bandage around the wounded arm, she directed
Moll to take her place beside the sick bed, and went out to
prepare, with her own careful little hands, a delicate repast
for the invalid.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was noon before the sea had sufficiently subsided to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>make it safe for a boat to be sent to the mainland. And
thus it was night before old Dr. Crampton arrived. He
was shown immediately to the room of the patient. Willful’s
hurt was a simple fracture, and the bone was easily
set. The old physician praised the skill of the young
nurse, but bade her  go now and take care of herself.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it was so late the doctor remained through the night,
and until after breakfast the next morning. Then, while
the boat was being prepared to take him to the main land,
he paid, in company with his young hostess, a final visit to
his patient, whom he found clear of febrile symptoms, and
getting on very well.</p>

<p class='c013'>And it was now that, with the physician seated on one
side of the bed, and the young mistress of the house on the
other, Willful Brande spoke of the circumstances of his
shipwreck.</p>

<p class='c013'>He informed his hearers that he had lately returned
from the Mediterranean in the United States sloop-of-war
Yorktown, now lying at the Norfolk Navy-yard; that he
had left his ship and taken passage on board the schooner
Nautilus from Norfolk for Baltimore, where he was going
to join his sister, who expected to sail from New York to
meet him there by a certain date; but that in the storm of
the preceding evening the doomed vessel had been, as they
knew, wrecked.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Were none but yourself saved?” inquired Etoile,
mournfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young lady, I think it likely <em>all</em> were saved! I will
tell you. As soon as it was seen that the vessel must go
down, when it was known that the water was rushing into
the hold faster than two men at the pumps could pump
it out, the crew took to the boats. The captain, the mate,
and myself remained the last upon the wreck. When we
saw every one else in safety we prepared to follow them.
But the boats were already full, and when those on board
<span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>saw us about to enter, a question arose among them, as to
whether they could bear the additional burden. It was
decided that they should not risk the trial. And so they
cut the ropes and deserted us. We were not willing, you
may judge, to be thus left to death. We threw off our
coats in an instant, and plunged into the sea to swim to the
boats. It seemed our only chance. The captain and the
mate, I hope, reached them in safety. For myself, I must
have been struck by a portion of the wreck and stunned,
for from the instant of my plunge I remember nothing
more until I found myself on your hospitable Island, where
I suppose a friendly wave, immediately after my fall, cast
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! it was base in the crew and passengers to desert
you and the brave officers. Still, I feel very much relieved
to hear that the shipwreck was not near so disastrous as I
had feared,” said Etoile, with a sigh of satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c013'>The boat was now reported ready, and the physician
arose to take his leave. He declared his patient doing
very well, left a few simple directions for his treatment,
promised to call the next day, and so departed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful Brande was ordered to lie quietly in bed for
another day and night, to partake of only light food and
cooling drinks, but was permitted to read or converse for
pastime.</p>

<p class='c013'>Now that it was ascertained that the patient was entirely
free from danger of death, Etoile appointed Moll and Timon
to wait upon him, while she, with an instinct of delicacy,
absented herself from the sick room, or visited it only
at stated times. But though absent, she occupied herself
diligently in the service of the invalid, and provided for
all his wants.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The house was restored to its usual condition, and the
grounds, as nearly as possible, cleared from the vestiges of
the late devastation; so that the surroundings of the young
heiress were once more, upon the whole, orderly and pleasant.
She returned to her usual employments, or occupied
herself with the care of her invalid guest. And with hope
mixed with fear, she hourly expected the arrival of her
guardian’s packet.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful Brande, lying on his sick couch and missing his
beautiful hostess from the room, gave himself up to wonder
and speculation. His position seemed to him like that of
one in a dream or in a fairy tale—cast away on a charming
island, and cared for by a lovely maiden, who seemed its
only white inhabitant, and, youthful as she was, “Monarch
of all ‘she’ surveyed.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He had certainly heard of L’Orient Isle, and of the good
old man who ruled it; though it was as a memory of his
childhood that the story now recurred. But who, then, was
this angelic girl, who seemed its queen? She knew the
Headland, and had once seen his sister! Willful at last
remembered! She must be the child of whom he had once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>heard Barbara speak, and who was now grown to womanhood.
But how was it that she was left alone? Had she
neither parent nor guardian, or had her guardian deserted
his post? What <em>was</em> the meaning of her extraordinary
position? However Willful might speculate upon these
questions, one thing was certain, that the bright and beautiful
young face that, like an angel of healing, had beamed
over his couch of pain, charming away the fever and distress,
had left an impression on his youthful heart, never to
be erased.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have saved my life, but I have lost my peace,” said
the poor youth, tossing about on his couch of uneasiness.
“Yes, life is saved, but peace is lost; for whatever she be,
this rare beauty, this young queen, is not for Willful Brande,
the poor midshipman! I must get up and get away from
the domains of this maiden Dido.”</p>

<p class='c013'>To get up was possible; but to get away at will was
quite another matter. Vessels came not every day to the
Isle, at the bidding of those who longed to get off.</p>

<p class='c013'>While Willful was wondering, speculating, and planning
in his room above, his young hostess was hospitably engaged
in preparing for his reception below. She had her
own charming boudoir set in festive order; fresh flowers
put in all the vases; the windows opening upon the flower-garden
hoisted; the communicating doors between the boudoir
and the conservatory on the right, and the aviary on
the left, opened, so that the songs of birds and the fragrance
of flowers were wafted through; and lastly, a luxurious
chair wheeled beside a table, upon which stood a vase of
rich exotics and a selection of attractive books. She sat in
the pleasant window seat, with her embroidery-frame in her
hand, and attended by her woman Moll and her maid
Peggy, upon the morning when Willful Brande, still very
pale, and wearing his arm in a sling, was shown in by old
Timon.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>Etoile at once arose, held out her hand to welcome him,
and begged him to take the chair by the table.</p>

<p class='c013'>Timon immediately brought him a glass of wine and a
cracker, which his young hostess, in her character of deputy
doctor, commanded him to swallow.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful Brande felt at once flattered and embarrassed by
these friendly attentions, which, by the way, the high-toned
and fine-spirited young islander would have lavished upon
any venerable cripple with as much pleasure as upon this
handsome youth.</p>

<p class='c013'>When he had obeyed her, and swallowed the wine, and
the little cut-glass service had been taken away, Etoile resumed
her pleasant seat in the window, her two maids, Moll
and Peggy, stood dutifully near her, engaged in knitting,
and her old footman Timon waited in the hall without.
More and more did the position and circumstances of this
young creature impress Willful Brande as resembling the
state of some petty old world princess—even in the dignified
ease and self-possession with which she did the honors of
her house.</p>

<p class='c013'>An hour passed in pleasant conversation, during which
Willful Brande incidentally learned that the young heiress
had a guardian who was now temporarily absent. But he
did not learn that guardian’s name, far less the cause of his
voyage from home, or his contemplated marriage with his
ward.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful Brande felt that the more he saw of the beautiful
Etoile, the more irrecoverably his heart became involved,
and that the longer he should remain by her side, the more
terrible would be the wrench by which he should have to
tear himself away. And his resolution to escape became
confirmed. Turning to his young hostess with a smile, he
deferentially inquired what might be the means of leaving
the Island for the nearest port.</p>

<p class='c013'>“We have nothing but little sail-boats that take our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>messengers to and fro, between the main land and the Isle.
Any one here who wishes to go further, is obliged to hail
some passing packet to take them off,” replied the young
girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But these packets pass frequently?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir, not very frequently within hailing distance;
not more than once a week.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The look of disappointment on the face of Willful appealed
to the maiden’s sympathies.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am truly sorry, Mr. Brande,” she said, “that you
should be detained here against your pleasure and convenience;
but we will do all that we can to make your sojourn
with us as little tedious to yourself as the circumstances will
permit. The house and servants are quite at your disposal.
So, also, are the horses and the boats, when you can avail
yourself of them. Here are books and musical instruments,
pray consider them your own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am grateful from the depths of my soul for your kindness,
young lady; but—I ought to be away,” said Willful,
with a profound sigh, which she understood to be one of
regret at his own enforced stay. Believing this, she replied—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I know, of course, how tedious to one accustomed to
the world, must be life on this lonely Island.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tedious! good heaven! yes, it is as tedious as sipping,
drop by drop, some exquisite draught that one knows must
finally deprive him of reason!” thought Willful, bitterly.</p>

<p class='c013'>But she was regarding him compassionately with her
clear blue eyes, and, seeing him still overcast, she added—</p>

<p class='c013'>“You will not have to remain long in this solitude.
Every day, indeed, every hour, I expect my guardian’s vessel.
He will bring friends with him, and then you will have
company and merry-making, which will help to enliven the
scene for you. And as my guardian’s packet is a chartered
one, she will remain over night to take us to Baltimore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>whence we travel by land to New York. And as your
bourne is also Baltimore, we shall be happy to have you
along with us. So cheer up, wayfarer, for you shall soon
be with your own.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are kinder than the kindest, as well as fairer than
the fairest, young lady, and it is not anxiety to get away,
so much as it is the necessity of going that so disturbs
me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is the necessity so imminent?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes!” exclaimed Willful, in a deep, agitated voice,
that caused her to look up in surprise to his face to find
his eyes fixed upon her with an expression of warm admiration.
But with the air of a detected culprit Willful
hastily dropped his glance and blushed to the very edges
of his hair.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile compassionated without understanding the occasion
of his disturbance, and addressed herself more zealously
to the hospitable task of entertaining her guest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you like music, Mr. Brande?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Excessively, if one can be said to like any good thing
excessively.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What instrument do you prefer? Look around, here
is a pianoforte, a harp, guitar and lute. Name your
choice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I like the instrument of God’s workmanship, ‘the
human <em>voice</em> divine,’” said Willful significantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then the guitar is the best accompaniment for that,”
she replied, and taking the instrument from the ready hands
of her maid, who had hastened to present it, she tuned the
strings and commenced—no silly love ditty such as make up
nine-tenths of the sum of current musical literature—but
Samuel Lever’s beautiful song, “My Mother Dear”—then
first published. Etoile sung with a self-forgetfulness, a
passion, and a pathos seldom equaled. As the last words
died on the ear, and the tones of the singer’s voice trembled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>into silence, Willful dashed a tear from his fine, dark eye,
and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is a beautiful song.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No—I don’t know that it is beautiful; but it is my
favorite,” replied Etoile, in a tone of voice that still quivered
with emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You loved your mother very much,” said Willful,
gently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Say—I <em>love</em> her ‘very much’—above all human creatures,
and only less than the Creator. And yet I never set
my orphaned eyes upon my mother’s face; but that is no
reason why I may not remember her in my song and in my
prayers.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You never saw your mother, and yet you love her so!”
exclaimed Willful in a thrilling voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, Mr. Brande! The sweet poet who wrote the
sweetest song of home was all his life a homeless wayfarer
throughout the world! So I, who never saw the face of
my mother, love best the songs that speak of a mother’s
love. In all my life I heard but two or three words about
her. It was in my childhood, and by chance, that I heard
my grandmother speak of her to my uncle. Then I only
learned that she was a young thing, scarcely so old as I am
now, when her proud English relations carried her off, and
I was left. Then, I do not know when I received the impression,
but I always had the idea that my mother had
very dark eyes and black hair, and that with all perhaps <em>I</em>
resembled her. And so what do you think I did this
summer?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful smiled and shook his head; he could not answer.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, out of her supposed likeness to myself, and out
of her fancied dark hair and eyes, I painted an imaginary
picture of my mother. See!” said Etoile, drawing the
locket from her bosom and revealing the miniature to her
companion.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>Willful took it, looked upon it, and started,—a tide of
emotion swept through his frame.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was the counterfeit resemblance of Estelle herself.
He knew the history of the beautiful English lady who had
been his sister’s tenant. A crowd of coincidences rushed
upon his memory and confirmed the suspicions that had
flashed into his mind. But discretion held him, as yet,
silent upon the subject of this possible discovery.</p>

<p class='c013'>He raised his eyes to the face of the young girl.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You say, Miss L’Orient, that this is only a fancy
sketch?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! not exactly so. It is painted from a strong
impression on my mind. The outward expression of an
inward belief.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You <em>must</em>, in your unconscious infancy, have seen some
face or portrait that made this impression upon your mind,
even though you may have forgotten the circumstance.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“No! I think not—one cannot be sure; but why do you
imagine such a thing?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why,” said Willful, evasively, “such <em>impressions</em> are
usually unconscious recollections.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Feeling now that she had said perhaps too much of her
own affairs, Etoile became silent. And Willful formed the
secret determination to say nothing of the discovery he had
made, until he should first consult his sister Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Three more days passed, and yet no news of the expected
packet. And now to the stormy weather had succeeded a
calm so profound as to leave no reasonable hope of soon
seeing a sail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile exerted herself, all but too successfully, to console
her guest for his “unwilling” detention. She introduced
him to her birds, to her exotics, to all her best books,—she
rambled with him over the Island, showing him all her
favorite haunts; she sailed with him around the shore, and
challenged him, as soon as his arm should get well, to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>gallop around the race-course. And despite her anxiety
to hear of or see her guardian, never had Etoile been so
gay, so buoyant and so happy, as now that she enjoyed for
the first time the society of a companion near her own age.</p>

<p class='c013'>Day by day the acquaintance between the youth and
maiden thus strangely thrown together, thus isolated from
all the world and dependent solely upon each other for
conversation and amusement, progressed toward friendship
on one side, and passionate love on the other.</p>

<p class='c013'>Day by day, when walking by her side; glancing stealthily
at her beautiful face; listening to her sweet voice; feeling
the fascination of her gentle manners—Willful Brande felt
his honorable resolution of silence giving way. Still, as
yet, he steadfastly restrained himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am not her equal in wealth and station. I will not
take advantage of my present position to breathe one word
of love in her defenseless young ear—no, not if my heart
were to break!” said Willful to himself. But each succeeding
day he found it harder to keep this resolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>As for Etoile, she felt her innocent affections so drawn
out by the youth who had been cast upon her Isle, and who
was now her daily associate, that she began to dread the
coming of the hour that should take him from her sight.
And this was all natural, probable, inevitable! Besides
her old uncle and her middle-aged guardian, Willful Brande
was the only white man she had ever seen. Willful was
young, amiable and eminently handsome, his manly beauty
of form and features were enhanced by a frank, ardent and
intellectual expression of countenance that ever won the
confidence, esteem and friendship of all appreciating persons
among whom he might be thrown.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Etoile’s innocent regard for her guest was testified
in a thousand graceful kindnesses, each of which nearly threw
her young lover off his guard and cast him at her feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Willful Brande was the very soul of honor.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>“I must govern my feelings! I must not abuse hospitality!
I must wait until her guardian shall return and she
shall be fully under his protection, and then, perhaps!”—he
exclaimed, giving wings to his youthful imagination. Meanwhile
he no longer desired to escape from the Island; and
for Etoile, as I said, she dreaded the hour of his departure.</p>

<p class='c006'>One afternoon the youth and maiden were seated on the
rude bench down on the beach, near the usual landing,
watching the almost motionless surface of the water.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you think that this calm can continue long, Mr.
Brande?” inquired Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I suppose not—though it may break up in another
storm,” replied Willful, gravely.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now, may the Lord in his mercy forbid!” exclaimed
Etoile, fervently clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So pray I! I never see a storm arise, without a sickening
of the soul,—not for dread of what is coming, but in
memory of what has gone! The sea has been very fatal to
my race, Miss L’Orient!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! has it been so?”—murmured the maiden, raising
her eyes, full of sympathy, to his face. “I hope it was
only vessels and cargoes, and not any near relative or dear
friend that you lost?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My father, my two elder brothers, and my brother-in-law,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>all went down together in their lost vessels,” said the young
man, sorrowfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, what a calamity! I can deeply feel for you, Mr.
Brande,” she said in a voice tremulous with emotion, as she
lifted her tearful, blue eyes again to his troubled face—“I
can deeply feel with you, for I, too, have been a sufferer by
the sea!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are all sympathy and benevolence, dear young lady!
And <em>you</em> a sufferer by the sea? I grieve to hear
that. But I hope you have not suffered so deeply as myself?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I lost my father and my grandmother. But it is true
that I did not feel the loss so deeply as I ought to have
done, perhaps, for I had never seen my father, and had lost
sight of my grandmother for years before they died.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful recollected now, that Monsieur and Madame
L’Orient had been lost on the Mercury. He scarcely knew
what reply to make to the  earnest-hearted girl beside him.
He knew perfectly well that the loss of her father was anything
but a misfortune to her, still it would never do to tell
her so, nor yet would it be honest to express a condolence,
not felt, upon this subject. He contented himself with
respectfully pressing her hand, and saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—I remember now—they were passengers on the
same vessel, the Mercury, in which my father, my brothers,
and my poor sister’s betrothed, Julius Luxmore, went
down.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Julius Luxmore!</span>” exclaimed the maiden, in amazement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, young lady! Why should that name cast you in
such a state of consternation? I beg your pardon.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why Julius Luxmore was not lost! he was saved!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Good heaven! I had even heard such a rumor; but
never believed it! And never breathed it to Barbara!”
thought Willful to himself. Then aloud he inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>“Will you forgive the question and tell me—are you
certain of the truth of that which you have just announced,
young lady?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Assuredly! Mr. Luxmore was saved from the wreck of
the Mercury. He brought us the news of the death of my
father and grandmother. He brought us also such of my
father’s effects as were picked up on the sand-bank. And
above all, he brought a will which constituted him guardian
of my father’s heiress.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yourself?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Certainly! And from that time to this, excepting the
three winter months of last year, Mr. Luxmore has lived
exclusively with us.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Great Heaven! what perfidy!” exclaimed Willful
Brande, in his heart; but from respect to his young hostess,
his lips were silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>She continued—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since the decease of my dear uncle, Mr. Luxmore has
been my sole guardian and protector, as he will soon be my——”
She started, blushed, reflected an instant and then
in a low and thrilling voice inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'>“What was that you said about Mr. Luxmore being the
betrothed husband of your sister?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My honored young hostess, I spoke indiscreetly; pray
pardon me,” said Willful, in a troubled tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande, do <em>you</em> pardon my persistence and tell me,
in plain terms, whether or not, Julius Luxmore was affianced
to your sister.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My dearest Miss L’Orient, Mr. Luxmore is your legal
guardian. Let us talk no more of him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande! I have the most important, the most vital
interest in the question that I have put to you—I do beseech
you answer it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young lady,——” began Willful, in a voice of distress
that was quickly interrupted by Etoile, who clasping her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>hands and raising her eyes in the earnestness of her entreaty,
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande, I must tell you all! Mr. Luxmore, my
guardian, has taught me to believe that I am his destined
bride; and he has promised me that when we are married,
and not until then, he will take me into the world and present
me to my dear mother’s relations. Now, not to see
that world—nor even to possess ten thousand such worlds,
would I marry a man who has broken faith with another
woman, for it would be a fearful sin, invoking the judgment
of God upon my head! Therefore, if this man, who seeks
my hand, was the betrothed of Barbara Brande, tell me
and save me from the sin and sorrow of wedding him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful Brande was agitated. His strong impulse was
to say to her at once—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—the base traitor! he broke faith with Barbara!
he deceived and deserted her at her utmost need;” but a
high, chivalrous magnanimity held him silent. He said to
himself—“It may be that she loves him; and that he may
yet grow worthy of such love—if so, though my heart
should burst, I will refrain from saying any thing to destroy
her confidence in him.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do not speak, Mr. Brande! Oh, answer me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss L’Orient!” exclaimed the young man taking her
hand, and speaking with the deepest respect—“forgive the
question that I am about to ask you and answer it, as true
soul to soul: you say that you are contracted in marriage
to your guardian—do you love him?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed, I do not know! I <em>tried</em> to like him, because I
always thought it was my duty to do so; but if I find he has
been a recreant to another love, I am sure I shall utterly
cease to esteem him. Therefore—I adjure you by your
honor to inform me—was Julius Luxmore the betrothed
husband of Barbara Brande?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss L’Orient, thus adjured, I have no choice but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>reply—Yes! Julius Luxmore <em>was</em> the betrothed husband
of Barbara Brande, with whom, without just cause, he broke
faith!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile was gazing intently into his face as though she
would read his soul. She saw in his frank, serious, earnest
countenance, his perfect truthfulness. She felt and knew
what he said to be a fact; many little circumstances, heretofore
inexplicable, now easily to be understood, recurred
to her memory in corroboration of his statement; her instinct,
hitherto repressed as injustice, was now explained
and justified. But the young Etoile possessed the excellent
faculty of self-control. No exclamation of astonishment or
loathing escaped her lips. Only with her serious eyes still
questioning Willful’s countenance, in a low voice, she further
inquired—</p>

<p class='c013'>“But why should he have abandoned his betrothed? She
was such a noble girl! one of nature’s queens! I saw her
once, you know, before ever trouble came to her, a Boadicea
she looked! a royally beautiful Amazon! Why should he
have abandoned her?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“For the prospect of a higher prize, no doubt, young
lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell me all you know of this man, Mr. Brande.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss L’Orient, I will. And do you pardon me for the
pain I may give you in the recital.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile folded her hands together and listened intently,
while Willful Brande related the story to Julius, from the
time of his adoption by Captain Brande, to that of his betrothal
to Barbara. He concluded by exposing the evident
fraud, by which Luxmore had succeeded in creating the false
impression of his own death.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile listened, struggling to remain calm and self-possessed;
but the trouble of her heart revealed itself in the
disturbance of her countenance. True, as the reader knows,
Etoile had never truly loved and never thoroughly esteemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>Julius Luxmore, still it was terrible to discover in one who
had so long been her companion, teacher, and confidant,
such utter unworthiness.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! it was base, it was wicked, it was atrocious, to
have abandoned his betrothed, the orphan daughter of his
friend, in the hour of her bitterest need, even augmenting
her anguish by laying upon her heart the grief of his supposed
death! Oh, it was heinous! There can scarcely be
pardon or redemption for a soul like that—God have mercy
on him!” cried Etoile, bursting into tears and dropping her
face upon her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I said that I should pain you—pray forgive me!”
pleaded Willful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is nothing to forgive; but much to thank you
for,” said Etoile, wiping her eyes, and holding out her
hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>The youth respectfully pressed the little hand and resigned
it. And both were silent for some minutes, during
which Etoile looked deeply thoughtful. At last the maiden
spoke:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande, you are older than I am, and you know
so much more of the world, that you can counsel me in this
strait.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young hostess, I would to heaven I had the experience
and wisdom to advise you, since you have no wiser friend.
But it may be, God will bless an honest intention, and put
good counsel into my mouth. Say on, Miss L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you, first of all, what I know of my own
story, which may aid you in judging what is best to be
done.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak, young lady; I listen.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, after a pause of thoughtful self-recollection, commenced
and related, with conscientious exactness, the short
story of her young life.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful listened with the profoundest interest, and, during
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>the progress of her narrative, became fully confirmed in his
impression that the Island maiden was really the lost child
of the beautiful Estelle. Still, discretion held him silent
upon this point; because, for all that he knew to the contrary,
that lovely lady might now be numbered with the
dead; and not for the world would he raise hopes in the
breast of her daughter, that might end in disappointment.
He resolved, that before hinting to Etoile the discovery he
had made, he would consult Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do not speak, Mr. Brande,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is because your story has so deeply interested me.
But name the point upon which you wished my humble
counsel, Miss L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“It is this—and oh, even while I speak, my heart shudders
with the fear that there may not be time to carry out
my plan! I shall not marry Mr. Luxmore—will not! cannot!
Do you hear? Nevertheless, see! a wind has sprung
up from the north, and every hour from this time we may
look to see his sail bearing down upon the Island. He will
come with the lawyer, the clergyman, and the license, to
claim my hand and carry me away.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss L’Orient, fear nothing. No power on earth can
compel you to give him your hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I know that!” replied Etoile, proudly; “simply
because, though all the forces of earth were brought to
bear upon me, I would refuse, and meet the consequences.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“There shall no evil happen to you so help me Heaven!
I am by your side,” exclaimed Willful, in a rush of enthusiasm,
that seemed to give him the strength of a lion, or
rather of a host.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are brave and faithful, I do not doubt. But my
guardian is armed with legal powers over my person and
my fate that, believe me, I feel sure he would not scruple
to use to the utmost, to gain his purposes.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>“True—good Heaven!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Therefore, you see, I must escape from the Island. My
resolution is formed,” said the maiden, who, woman-like,
had first made up her mind, and then asked advice. Willful
saw that she had unconsciously taken this initiative course,
and before offering any advice, he wished to know her own
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Escape! but how, whither, under what protection?
Speak, Miss L’Orient, for I am at your utmost disposal.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I have money, boats, and servants. I propose to lade
a boat, and go to Heathville, attended by two servants, and
escorted by yourself, if you are so good. At Heathville,
we can get some conveyance to New York, where you can
put me in the care of my faithful Maman, Madeleine.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Her plan betrayed such simple ignorance of life, that
Willful Brande listened in amazement.</p>

<p class='c013'>Nothing now could be easier than to run away with and
marry this beautiful and wealthy heiress, whom, besides, he
worshiped with all the ardor of a young heart’s first and
passionate love. And nine out of ten, placed in such circumstances,
would have yielded to the temptation of which
he certainly felt the force.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Willful Brande was, as I have said, the soul of
honor; not for a kingdom—not even for his loved one—would
he stain his manhood with a single unworthy act.
He remained silent and thoughtful, not knowing how, with
sufficient delicacy, to convey to her the knowledge that her
plan was inadmissible.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do not answer me, Mr. Brande,” she said.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young lady, because I do not know how to explain to
one so inexperienced, that the proposed plan, if carried
out, would expose you to much censure.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“But why?” inquired the maiden, in much amazement.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Because a young man, unless he is a near relative, is
not considered a proper escort in a long journey for a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>lady. Besides, it would be almost impossible in the wilderness
of New York city to find your nurse Madeleine, nor
even if found would she, only a mulatto servant, however
good and faithful, be considered a proper protector for a
young lady,” replied Willful, with a deep sigh, for the
temptation was overcome, but the prize was lost.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then what <em>shall</em> I do to escape this impending danger?
You see, now, how necessary your counsel is to me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Heaven save the poor maiden who has no wiser counselor
than the youth who loves her,” thought Willful to
himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, Mr. Brande, well, can you advise me what to do?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Have you no friends or acquaintance upon the main
land in whom you could place confidence?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, no! none but old Doctor Crampton, who lives at
Heathville, with his two old maiden sisters.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“The very man, if he would only be friendly to you.
He looks honest and courageous.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, he <em>is</em> honest and brave! I have known him a long
time—I never had a doubt of him,” said Etoile, warmly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And do you think he would befriend you against your
guardian?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, if his conscience were satisfied, for he loves me as
his own child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And how far is Heathville from this place?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Before this wind, about two hours’ sail.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then your course is clear, Miss L’Orient. Order your
boat to be prepared. While it is being got ready, pack
up such necessary articles, or such valuables, as you may
wish to carry with you; take your servants, Moll and
Timon, to attend you; and I will myself escort you in
safety and honor to the house of your old friend the physician,
to whom you will tell your story, and under whose
protection you can appeal from your guardian’s authority
to the Orphans’ Court.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>“There will be no impropriety in that, of course?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Not the slightest—else I had not proposed it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And you, what will you do?” inquired the maiden, with
interest.</p>

<p class='c013'>“After having seen you in honor and safety under the
protection of friends, I shall go on my way to Baltimore,”
replied the young man, smothering the sigh that arose in
his bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>“And—when shall I see you again?” inquired the young
girl, in a tremulous tone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Would you care ever to see me more?” asked Willful,
in a voice full of deep emotion.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Indeed I should! And I wish to know before we
separate when I shall see you again, so that I may have the
joy of looking forward to that time.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“When the Lord and yourself wills,” replied Willful,
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“If it depended upon my will it should be very soon,” she
said, gently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But in the meantime, if your friends approve, I would
like to write to you, Miss L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why, of course my friends will approve, why should
they not?” she artlessly inquired.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful smiled sadly, shook his head, and instead of replying
directly to the question, said:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Delays are dangerous, Miss L’Orient.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! I know they are! especially in this instance, when
any hour may bring my guardian’s sail in sight. I will
go now and pack up. Will you do me the favor to order
the boat?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful nodded in obedience, and Etoile hurried away.</p>

<p class='c013'>Great was the astonishment of the Island servants when
they learned that their young lady, who had never before
left her insular home, was now about to take a trip to
Heathville, to see old Doctor Crampton and his maiden
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>sisters. For the latent object of the visit was of course
withheld from their knowledge. They settled it among
themselves that the old physician, when last at the Island,
must have given the invitation; and after their first surprise
was over, they declared that it was natural and right for
their young lady to have this recreation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But what shall we say to Marse Julius, if he should
come ’fore you get back, Miss Etwill?” inquired one of the
old men.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Tell him where I have gone—that is all,” answered the
maiden. “Once in sanctuary there, I have no cause to
fear him,” she mentally added.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was with a deeply agitated mind and a wildly beating
heart that Etoile, attended by Willful Brande, and followed
by her two faithful servants, took her way down to the boat
that waited to bear her from the only home she had ever
known, to those untrodden shores she had so ardently
desired to reach.</p>

<p class='c013'>When about half way down the lowest avenue leading
from the house to the landing, she met a little negro boy
running toward her with the joyful countenance of one who
thinks he brings glad tidings.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! Miss Etwill,” said the lad, “the packet has just
come to anchor out there, an’ Marse Julius an’ some gemmen
are in the long-boat, rowin’ to the shore.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Heaven!” exclaimed Etoile, clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Fear nothing, young lady,” said Wilfull.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>A boat was pushed up on the sands, and a party consisting
of Julius Luxmore and two gentlemen landed, and
advanced up the avenue toward the spot where Etoile and
Willful remained awaiting them. Mr. Luxmore started
and frowned at beholding a strange youth standing by the
side of his jealously-guarded ward; but in a moment he
regained his composure and concealed his annoyance.
Meeting the young pair, he bowed to both at once; then
greeted his young charge by name and presented to her,
in turn, the Reverend Doctor Goode and Mr. Attorney
Bonde.</p>

<p class='c013'>The maiden, who had remained standing pale and firm,
awaiting this rencounter, responded to these introductions
only by cold bows.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then Mr. Luxmore said, in a low and courteous voice,
free from any sign of the vexation he really felt, and speaking
as though recalling his ward to a sense of propriety—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Present your guest, my dear Etoile.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But before the young lady could comply, Willful Brande
stepped forward somewhat boldly, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“It appears that you have forgotten your old captain’s
son, Mr. Luxmore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Luxmore started and changed color; but instantaneously
recovering his presence of mind, he exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Truly, my young friend, I had not at first recognized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>you; but, then, so many years have elapsed since we met.
How are you, Mr. Brande?” and offered his hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Willful drew his tall form up to its fullest height,
folded his arms, and fixed a glance full of scorn steadily
upon the face of the recreant.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Why will you not take my offered hand, Willful?” inquired
Luxmore, forcing a smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>No, Sir!</span> I take the hand of no traitor.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“What do you mean by that, sir?” exclaimed Luxmore,
growing white about the lips.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Shall I explain, sir? I am quite ready to do so,” retorted
Willful, scornfully.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, I do not doubt that you would force a quarrel upon
me here, in the presence of a lady and a clergyman; but <em>I</em>
have more respect for such company; another time, sir!
another time!” replied the detected villain, seizing the sole
pretext that presented itself for the postponement of the
exposure.</p>

<p class='c013'>“As you will,” said Willful Brande, his lip curling.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gentlemen, move forward to the house, if you please.
Etoile, my dear, take my arm. Good-afternoon, Mr. Brande,”
said Luxmore, with the air of dismissing Willful.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Etoile shrank from the traitor’s offered arm, and
merging the bashfulness of the girl in the dignity of the
lady hostess, she went around to her guest, and with a
stately courtesy said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande, will it please you to return to the house?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful started, bowed, and smiled acceptance of her invitation.
He then, with an air of deep respect, offered his
arm. But Etoile, with her nice sense of propriety, with
a gracious smile and shake of the head, declined the proffered
assistance, and walked on singly.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore came to her side, and in a low, stern voice,
inaudible to other ears, inquired:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss L’Orient, what is the meaning of this conduct?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>“It means, Mr. Luxmore, that before this affair proceeds
further, you and myself must have a serious conversation,”
replied the young girl, in no degree daunted by the frowns
of the unmasked perjurer, but solicitous to preserve, before
strangers, the proprieties of peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah, I see how it is; but do not think to escape me.
An hour hence decides our destiny!” muttered Luxmore, as
he left her side and drew near to his guests, the clergyman
and the lawyer.</p>

<p class='c013'>They soon now reached the house. Mr. Luxmore and
his friends passed into the drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful Brande, feeling the awkwardness of his position,
yet determined not to desert the cause of the friendless girl,
threw himself on the wicker settee in the hall.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile went into her own boudoir, and sat down to collect
her thoughts, and nerve herself for the coming altercation
with her guardian. She had not long remained alone
before the door opened, and old Moll entered, bearing a
large but light bandbox, which she set upon the table and
opened, and from which she drew forth a splendid bridal
dress and vail.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come, Miss Etwill, honey, better make haste an’ ’ray
yourself ’cause Marse Julius whispered to me, how de passon
and the lawyer were a waitin’, an’ how he hiss’f wanted
to get off from here ’fore night wid de tide.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Go and tell Mr. Luxmore that I wish to see him here
immediately, and do you also return and remain within the
sound of my voice.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old woman obeyed, and almost immediately afterward,
Mr. Luxmore entered—his fair face pallid, his hazel
eyes glittering with excitement. He saw at a glance—by
the compressed lips, steady eyes and stern brow of Etoile
that his power over her was in a great measure gone—that
he would never more influence her through her love, however
he might through her <em>fears</em>. He did not understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>that the only manner in which that young creature could
be governed was through her affections or through her conscience.</p>

<p class='c013'>Burying all these misgivings in the depths of his secretive
and guileful heart, however, he resolved to take a daring
course, ignoring any change, and addressing her, as though
nothing had happened to peril their friendship. He advanced,
holding out his hand, and saying with an affectation
of joyous confidence—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well, my fair bride, what is your sweet capricious will
with me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stand back, sir!” exclaimed Etoile, recoiling and holding
up her hand in deprecation of his further advance.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What the demon do you mean by this, Miss L’Orient?”
he exclaimed, simulating astonishment and honest indignation.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I wonder, sir, that the presence of Willful Brande on
this Island does not of itself explain my meaning!” said
Etoile, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“True, by all the Cupids!” cried Luxmore, with a sardonic
laugh; “during my absence to arrange the preliminaries
of our marriage, a beardless boy gets himself shipwrecked
on the Island, and that circumstance suffices to
cause you to meet with scorn one who comes by agreement
to claim your promised hand.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Mr. Luxmore, and why?—Because it falls out in
conversation that ere you offered to my acceptance a perjured
heart, you basely broke faith with one of the noblest
creatures that ever trod the earth—one to whom not only
the ties of affection but of plighted faith, and of gratitude,
should have bound you through life and unto death—your
patron’s daughter, Barbara Brande. You broke faith with
her under circumstances that so deepen and darken the
heinousness of your perjury, as to render it unparalleled in
the annals of treachery. And, in one word, Mr. Luxmore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>before I would give my hand in marriage to such a traitor,
I would thrust it into the fire and hold it there until it
should be consumed to ashes!” said the maiden, with the
unflinching firmness of a Mucius Scævola.</p>

<p class='c013'>The suddenness and the severity of this retort so astounded
Julius Luxmore that for a moment he stood staring
the image of consternation. When volition returned, it
came borne on a tide of diabolical fury. He grew livid in
the face, his eyes started, his lips foamed, his form was convulsed;
he strode toward her with his arm outstretched,
and his fist clenched, exclaiming in the low, deep muttering,
murderous tone of indomitable will and remorseless wickedness—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young woman! do you know that soul, body, and estate,
you are mine, mine only, mine utterly—my slave, my property,
my chattel; do you know, that as your sole guardian, and
the disposer of your person and property, I have the power
to imprison, chastise, or otherwise coerce you to my will?
Answer me, minion, do you know this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>The young creature drew her slight form up with queenly
dignity and regarded the man before her with a look of such
ineffable scorn, that, infuriate as he was, he blenched beneath
her gaze. Then—when he had quailed, she answered,
slowly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Luxmore, I know not how far your powers as legal
guardian may permit you to go, nor how remorselessly you
may use them, nor how much beyond their rightful limit
you may stretch them. <span class='sc'>But this I do know</span>,” she said,
and her slight form arose and dilated and her eyes blazed—“that
neither man on earth, nor demon in Hades, has
power to compel me to become your wife! And why?
Because sooner would I give my body to be burned!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ho! my girl! I can reduce your pride!” he exclaimed,
striding toward her, with uplifted hands, as though to clutch
her.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>“Hold off! My attendants wait within call!” she said,
recoiling and holding up her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ho, ho! verily my little girl must think herself a princess!”
exclaimed Julius Luxmore, with sarcastic malignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Truly, I have so long lived under that illusion, that I
cannot all at once dispel its influence! And thus much of
queenship remains to me at least, sir, that in a strait my
servants would support their legitimate mistress against
her false and grasping guardian!” said Etoile, in calm
dignity.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ha, ha, ha!” laughed the traitor in malicious derision.
“I would have you to know, young Madame, that my position
is a legal one, and that any resistance on the part of
yourself or your servants would expose you to the punishment
I should deem it proper to inflict, and them to the
utmost penalties of the law—even to death!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, at this threat of ruin to her people, changed
color, but after a moment answered calmly—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will not then expose my devoted servants to your remorseless
vengeance, Julius Luxmore; but as regards myself,
your threats are unavailing; do your utmost will, you
will find me immovable. No, sir! the prize that you have
perjured your soul and broken a heart to gain, has escaped
you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a face that had not yet regained its natural color,
a face of white death, but for the ferocity of those burning,
brown eyes, he glared upon her a moment, and then turning,
walked with rapid strides up and down the floor. He
could have cursed the sudden passion that had deprived him
of his presence of mind, and betrayed him to the exhibition
of the very worst phase of his very bad nature. “Why the
fiend! could I not have controlled my temper! I might
have wrought upon her feelings, through habit, through
affection, through gratitude, through pity. I might even
have beaten down this young man’s testimony, and secured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>her to myself! and then! and then! But now——” he
thought, grinding his teeth in rage——“And yet it may
not be too late! I may yet impress her with the belief
that all my rage arose from baffled <em>love of her</em>, and if she
is woman, she will forgive it!” he reflected. All at once,
with his great power of simulation, he changed his expression
of countenance, from rage and hatred to passionate
love and despair, and burying his face in his hands, walked
up and down, groaning in heart-broken tones—“Etoile!
oh, Etoile!”</p>

<p class='c013'>But the young lady paid no attention to his change of
mood. Mindful, amid all her distress, of her duties as
hostess, she touched her bell, and when her aged attendant
opened the door, she said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aunt Moll, go and give orders in the kitchen, that
supper be prepared for these strangers, and afterward do
you see to the guest chambers in case they should remain
all night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>And when the old dame withdrew to obey, Etoile took
her needle-work, and went and sat in her favorite shaded
window seat, to pursue her work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Etoile! my Etoile!” moaned Luxmore, with his
face buried in his hands, as he strode to and fro.</p>

<p class='c013'>She bestowed not the slightest notice upon his raving,
but quietly continued her sewing. Suddenly he broke off
from his walk, and threw himself down beside her, and attempted
to seize her hand. She shrank in abhorrence from
him. He did not pursue the point, but, breaking forth in
a simulation of vehement passion, exclaimed—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Etoile, Etoile, you are angry, outraged, and it is
natural that you should feel thus toward me! I was mad,
phrenzied, to have used such language toward you, my love,
my bride, my queen! But oh, child! child! you do not
understand the impassioned heart of man! how his love
betrayed, wounded and repulsed, turns to madness, instigating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>him to say and do things at other times abhorrent
to his soul! He may become a brute, and rage as I have
raged to you, or a fool, to fill some lunatic’s cell, or a
homicide, and slay his false love! I would not hurt one
golden ringlet of your beautiful head—and yet see how
you have maddened me.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile threaded her needle afresh, and quietly pursued
her work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Etoile! Etoile! how can you go on calmly with
such trifles, when you behold my agony?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How could <em>you</em> go on calmly with your lustrum of falsehood,
and leave that bereaved and broken-hearted girl to
struggle through her hard life alone?” retorted the maiden,
with the color flushing for an instant to her cheek.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Etoile, my child! be not so cruel! Look in my
face!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I cannot see it for the face of Barbara Brande, that is
ever before me in her long years of faithful maiden widowhood!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Etoile! Etoile! you will drive me mad! pursue me to
desperation! arm my hand against—not you, beloved and
beautiful one; forgive me, that in my extremity of phrenzy,
I ever said a thing so atrocious—but against my own
wretched life!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even this raving failed to produce the least effect upon
the young lady, who went on composedly with her work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Behold how you treat me! I who have loved you
above all earthly things, from your infancy up! I who
watched over your culture——”</p>

<p class='c013'>“My <em>intellectual</em> culture only. The Lord pity me if you
had the direction of my <em>moral</em> training. For all this, Mr.
Luxmore, I am just as grateful as I should be to a guardian
who educated his ward, an heiress, for his own pride, pleasure,
and benefit, and with the view of her eventually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>becoming his own wife!” said the maiden with cool contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But it was because I loved you! I loved you, my
Etoile, above all created beings!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye! you loved me so well that you confined me
closely to this Island, where I panted like a caged bird for
freedom, and where you made my marriage with yourself
the only condition of my liberation!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Well! yes! little as you understand it, child, that
which you have spoken in irony was indeed true! I love
you, my inestimable treasure, so exclusively, that I cannot
endure that the covetous eyes of another should rest upon
you. Yet, once mine irrevocably, I shall take you all over
the world—I shall devote my life to the sweet task of
making you happy! But, how do you repay my love? Oh,
Etoile, how do you repay it? I go away to prepare for
our marriage; I make all proper arrangements; I lay the
whole city under contribution for your pleasure; I fill my
vessel with its costliest treasures for my Etoile; I set sail
for home; storms endanger my vessel, and calms delay her;
yet, at last, I reach the house of my love; ‘all on fire with
joy’ I rush to meet you; and how am I received? With
coldness, frowns, and scorn! And all because a stranger
youth is wrecked upon your shoals, and fills your ear with
a tale of scandal, to which you give a ready credulity, and
upon which, without proof on his side or defense on mine,
you condemn me!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I must answer that! He filled my ear with no tale of
scandal! Even could he have done so, I would not have
believed it! The truth came out too naturally, too providentially,
to have it mistaken for falsehood! We both
happened to speak of you—he as his dear brother-in-law,
wrecked in the Mercury. I, as my esteemed guardian,
saved from the Mercury. But when we approached the
subject—like two clouds charged with electricity—the truth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>as lightning, flashed forth broad and bright! There was
no mistaking it. Nor was that truth unsupported by proof—a
score of circumstances, trifling singly, overwhelming in
the mass—started up in my memory to corroborate the
testimony! and my own purest and profoundest instincts—long
felt and long repressed—arose to confirm it? For
yourself, though your case appears to me to be indefensible,
yet I am ready to hear what you have to say in its defense!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore was specious and plausible; he raised
his eyes to her face and said with an unctuous earnestness:</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Etoile, the subject of my defense is scarcely fit for
your delicate hearing. My passion for the beautiful Barbara
was a mere boyish flame that must soon have vainly
burned out. But there existed certain imminent reasons
why the family of Miss Brande should earnestly desire her
early marriage; thence they took advantage of my childish
predilection; they imposed upon my inexperience; in a
word, they entrapped me into an engagement with this
fallen goddess; and doubtlessly I should have suffered myself
to be finally and fatally victimized, had I not been so
<em>fortunate</em> as to be wrecked from her father’s vessel, the
Mercury, and to find myself rescued and invested with the
sole guardianship of an orphan heiress whom it was my
bounden duty to seek and cherish. Etoile, I sought and
found you, the one angel of my life whom I have loved with
a constantly increasing strength from the first moment of
our meeting to the present day. Etoile, this is my defense!”</p>

<p class='c013'>To all this Etoile replied—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Were it possible, Mr. Luxmore, for me to think worse
of you than I thought an hour ago, your defense must have
produced the effect of making me do so. When I listen to
you, I am led to believe that an evil heart must cloud a
man’s brain, so that he has not intellectual power sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>to deceive any save those whose perceptive faculties may
be also obscured from the same cause. Besides, Mr. Luxmore,
your mask fell quite off during the ‘short madness’ to
which you so lately succumbed!”</p>

<p class='c013'>The simplicity of her character, upon which Julius Luxmore
had so long practiced, upon which he had so long
relied for the accomplishment of his ends, was now turned
against him; and the honest verdict of her upright mind
was delivered with a freedom, plainness and directness, that
none but a creature so unconventional might have had,
under such circumstances, the courage to exercise.</p>

<p class='c013'>Julius Luxmore, more self-controlled than at first, paused
some time to reflect upon the manner in which he should
proceed. Then he renewed the attack. Persuasion, arguments,
threats were used in turn, and used in vain. Her
affections, her reason, and her fears were successively and
fruitlessly appealed to. Two hours were spent in a discussion
that it would be tedious here to repeat, as, after all, it
embodied what had been said before.</p>

<p class='c013'>At last, finding all his efforts to move her to his purposes
unavailing, Julius Luxmore once more lost his presence of
mind, and approaching her, exclaimed, in the deep tone of
concentrated rage—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, minion! You who despise my love shall
feel my power!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Luxmore, I almost pity you, that you should be so
weak as to suppose that you can intimidate me!” replied
the brave girl, calmly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Do you deny my authority?” he demanded, in a voice
of fury.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I intend to appeal from you, who have abused your
sacred trust, to the Orphans’ Court for protection!” she
answered, quietly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You do! ha, ha, ha! Why, minion, you are a prisoner.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>You shall not stir beyond this room until you cross its
threshold as my wife.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In that case I should remain here until my mortal frame
returned to dust. But you are mistaken, Mr. Luxmore; I
shall appeal for a hearing before the Orphans’ Court
through a friend who has been made acquainted with all my
wrongs!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Aye! that—that—<em>miscreant</em>, Willful Brande!” exclaimed
Luxmore, in a voice interrupted and almost inarticulate
with rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“No, sir; but through an aged gentleman to whom Mr.
Brande shall go,” replied Etoile, clipping her thread, and
quietly folding up her finished work.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He shall! but in the meantime there will be delay,
during which you will be in my power—and then! then in
the meantime!——”</p>

<p class='c013'>——“I will trust in God, desperate sinner! and no evil
shall befall me!” said Etoile, rising to leave the room. But
quick as lightning, Julius Luxmore intercepted and passed
her, went out and turned the key upon his prisoner.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the meanwhile, Willful Brande walked up and down
the front piazza, musing upon the strange situation of the
beautiful and friendless maiden. The more he reflected
upon the character and position of her guardian, the more
strongly he became convinced of the imminent necessity of
her being immediately delivered from his power. That Julius
Luxmore would not scruple to make use of any means for
the accomplishment of his purposes he felt assured. The
question with which his mind labored was, how to effect her
escape. While intensely studying this problem, his eye fell
upon old Timon sauntering alone through the grove. In
the time that he had spent on the Island, he had especially
noticed the great devotion of this aged servant to his fair
young mistress. He walked rapidly down the steps, across
the lawn, and into the grove, where the old man lingered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Timon took off his hat with his usual humble “Sarvint,
marster.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Timon—come further into the shade. I want to speak
to you of your young mistress. Tell me, now, whom do you
love best—Miss L’Orient, or Mr. Luxmore?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Timon looked up with a sly, intelligent smile, and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Young marster, I sees how things be gwine on! I done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>took notice ob Mr. Julius a-comin’ up from de boat; an’,
likewise, ob Miss Etwill. I sees good how she ain’t got a
minit for him now; and as for me, young marster, I is willin
to do any thin’ in dis worl’ to ’mote de happiness ob Miss
Etwill.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful blushed, lest his own motives should be misconstrued,
even by this most humble of judges, and he hastened
to say:</p>

<p class='c013'>“The change in your young lady’s opinion of her guardian
is not without the best reasons. And all that is necessary
to promote her happiness is to get her out of his power, and
under the protection of her old friend, Dr. Crampton and
his sisters, from whose house she can appeal to the Orphans’
Court.”</p>

<p class='c013'>While making this confidence, Willful Brande had narrowly
watched the countenance of the old man, whose honest
gaze did not once flinch, and who now replied:</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may trus’ me to de def wid anythin’ as is for Miss
Etwill’s good.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I do believe you. But is there any among the women
for whose fidelity in such a matter you could answer? because,
in her escape, Miss L’Orient should have a female
attendant.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marster, I can be sponsious for my ole ’oman, Moll—dat
is all. Not but what all de oders is hones’ ’nough, an’
love Miss Etwill ’nough; but den, marster, dey’s ’feared o’
Marse Julius. So, I wouldn’ like to trust ’em.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Can you procure a boat—let us see—between midnight
and day?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Who, me? Better ’lieve so, young marster! I has de
s’preme ’trol ob de boats.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then select a good, sound, safe boat, such as may be
managed by me and you. And, let me see—the most unfrequented
part of the Island is the bathing pool of your
young lady, Crystal Creek?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>“True for you, marster; no one ever sets foot there, ’cept
Miss Etwill and her maid.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“And the quietest time in the twenty-four hours is about
two o’clock in the morning. Now, Timon, can you have
the boat in readiness on Crystal Creek about that hour?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sartain, marster!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“How will you be able to know the time?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Marster, I gwine lay awake till midnight. I allers
knows when it is midnight by de crowin’ o’ de roosters; an’
sure<em>lie</em> I can guess at an hour or two beyant; anyways, ef
I should be a minit <em>before</em> two o’clock, be sure I won’t be
half a second <em>arter</em>.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well. Be vigilant and faithful, and you shall be
richly rewarded, old man,” replied Willful. And, after a
little more immaterial conversation, concerning the details
of the plans, these justifiable conspirators separated—the old
man to cautiously commence the preliminary arrangements of
the flight, and the youth to seek the house, and, if possible, find
means to communicate the plan to Etoile. As he turned to
leave the spot, the sound of a quick, retreating step fell on his
ear. He started, listened, and looked about; but neither hearing
nor seeing any one, he concluded that the fugitive steps
were those of a calf that he perceived gamboling at a short distance;
and so, with returning confidence, he hurried onward.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had scarcely left the grove, when the figure of a man
emerged from the cover of a thicket, and with a gesture of
hate and anticipated triumph, took a nearer path to the
house, which, unperceived, he reached before the arrival
thither of the midshipman.</p>

<p class='c013'>When Willful Brande entered, he was met by a servant,
who invited him to walk into the dining-room, where he
found the supper table spread, and the clergyman and the
lawyer, together with Mr. Luxmore, apparently waiting his
arrival.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Gentlemen, I bear to you the excuses of your fair young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>hostess, whom a sudden but temporary indisposition confines
to her chamber. Pray be seated, and ‘good digestion wait
on appetite, and health on both,’” said Mr. Luxmore, as
he assumed the head of the table. The board was well
spread with all the substantial delicacies of the season. A
footman served tea and coffee from the sideboard.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So, Etoile is a prisoner, then,” thought Willful, who
was not for an instant deceived by the pretext advanced by
Mr. Luxmore—“but it shall go hard but that I find means
to liberate her before morning.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The indisposition of the young lady was no doubt afterward
offered in explanation of the delay of the wedding.</p>

<p class='c013'>When all left the dining-room, Willful Brande went to
his chamber, wrote a few lines on a small piece of paper,
rolled it into a minute parcel, returned to the lower hall,
and walked to and fro the passage and the piazza, until he
found an opportunity of slipping the little scroll into the
hands of Moll with the swiftly whispered words:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give this into the hands of your young lady as soon as
possible.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a nod of intelligence, Moll concealed the scrip.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meantime Etoile, locked within her two rooms, “possessed
her young soul in patience.” Under Divine Providence
her hopes rested upon Willful Brande. Though no
confidential word had, since the interruption of her flight,
passed between herself and the youth, she felt assured that
he would not desert her cause; that he would, upon the
first opportunity, leave the Island and report the case to
her old friend Doctor Crampton, with the request that he
would appeal in her behalf to the Orphans’ Court. Meanwhile
she knew the danger to which she was constantly
exposed from the unscrupulous character of her guardian.
She even wondered whether he would now permit her
own servants to attend her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Night drew on, she heard from the distance “the tinkling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>of silver upon porcelain,” sounds of preparation for the
evening meal. After a few minutes she went to a side
window and looked out, and saw her guardian hurrying,
with disordered steps, toward the house. With a growing
aversion to his presence, she recoiled and left her point of
view. Soon after she heard the steps of Willful Brande
enter the front door, and then all proceed to the dining-room.
She closed her windows to keep out the dampness
of the evening that was falling humid and heavy. Lights
had not been brought her, and she sat down in darkness to
meditate upon her strange position.</p>

<p class='c013'>After awhile she heard the guests leave the dining-room
and proceed to the parlor, and Julius Luxmore’s voice in
conversation with the two gentlemen. Next she heard the
solitary step of Willful Brande pacing to and fro in the
passage, up and down the piazza; but at last he, too,
seemed to have left the scene, and all was silent. Half an
hour passed, and then the key was turned in the lock, and
her guardian, accompanied by old Moll, bearing a tray of
refreshments and a light, entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, on seeing him, turned her back and walked off to
the other end of the room. Old Moll, while busily engaged
in arranging refreshments upon a little stand, cautiously
endeavored to catch the eye of her young mistress, and at
last succeeded in exchanging with her a significant glance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore walked up and down the floor, watching
her keenly, but not attempting to address her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile bore this with patient dignity for a little while, and
then said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Since you use your power to confine me here, sir, you
should at least show ordinary delicacy in refraining from intruding
upon my privacy, at this unseemly hour of the
night.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I exercise the double privilege of your guardian and
your betrothed husband, young lady. And Etoile, I wished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>again to converse with you to-night,” he answered, then
turning to the old servant, he added: “Moll, leave the
room.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The old woman bowed obedience, and then making feints
to settle the spoon and fork for her young mistress, as soon
as Mr. Luxmore’s back was turned upon them in his walk,
she hastily slipped Willful Brande’s rolled note into her hand
and then withdrew from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Luxmore now returned on his walk, drew a chair to
the side of Etoile, and then, with all the eloquence he could
command, recommenced his suit. The young girl listened
with a curling lip, answered only when direct questions
were put to her, and then in a manner that must have utterly
repulsed any other than the desperate adventurer before
her; and him it nearly maddened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Luxmore, it is ten o’clock—an hour past my usual
one of retiring. You must see the necessity of now leaving
me,” at last she said, in a tone that compelled even the unscrupulous
man before her to respect her words.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well! I have given you this last opportunity.
You are obdurate, and my course is taken!”</p>

<p class='c013'>When he had left the room, Etoile unrolled her scrip and
read:</p>

<p class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Miss L’Orient</span>,—I advise you to retire early and try to
sleep as much as possible between this and the hour of two
in the morning. At that hour, one who watches will awaken
you, and a boat will wait at the Crystal Creek to convey
you to your friends on the main land.</p>

<div class='lg-container-r c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>W. B.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>On reading the note, with its prospect of immediate escape,
the heart of Etoile leaped with gladness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Meanwhile Willful Brande, loathing the sight of Julius
Luxmore, and his possibly mercenary guests, withdrew to
his own chamber, shut the door and seated himself by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>window, to pass the time as he might in meditation, or in
gazing out upon the dark, starlit expanse of waters.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sometime after ten o’clock, he heard the guests conducted
by Mr. Luxmore come up and enter their sleeping
rooms, which were upon the same floor with his own. He
heard their <em>soi disant</em> host, with much courtly politeness
take leave of them and go down stairs. Next he heard the
muffled motions of the guests in their final preparations for
bed. Then all was silent, until the clock struck eleven.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Twelve—one—two! Three hours yet! how shall I
live them through, here in darkness and solitude!” exclaimed
Willful to himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>He slipped off his shoes and paced softly up and down
the room for an indefinite time. Then growing impatient
of that resource, he laid himself down upon his bed. But
finding such absolute physical repose only the more aggravating
to his mental restlessness, he started up again and
resumed his pacing.</p>

<p class='c013'>How unsupportably weary the time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twelve o’clock struck! Two hours yet! When <em>would</em>
they come to an end? Surely the common reckoning of
time must be all false! He had passed years that seemed
shorter than these eternities of hours. He threw himself
down once more upon his bed, and compelled himself to lie
still for awhile.</p>

<p class='c013'>He had been lying thus for a few minutes when, in the
profound silence, he thought he heard the sound of a key
turned in a lock, and a footstep retreating toward the hall
staircase. He listened. All was silent.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It was one of our guests, perhaps,” he said to himself,
and he resolved to remain perfectly quiet, lest his motions
might also attract attention. But his anxiety increased.
The clock struck one.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But one hour more! Yet, oh! these hours! they seem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>eternities!” he said, as he softly left his couch and went and
sat by the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>He looked out, but all was so dark that even to his
accustomed eyes, trees and houses, land and water, earth
and sky, presented scarcely perceptible differences in shades
of blackness.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again he threw himself upon his couch; again grew impatient
of rest, and started up to pace the room; and yet
again seated himself at the window.</p>

<p class='c013'>Finally, his guardian angel inspired him with the idea of
profitably employing a portion of the weary time in praying
for the success of his undertaking. He sunk upon his knees
and prayed that he might be delivered from all selfish purposes
and serve the friendless orphan with an eye single to
her interest, and that the “Father of the fatherless” might
crown his efforts in her behalf with success. As he arose
from his knees the clock struck <span class='fss'>TWO</span>!</p>

<p class='c013'>He took his hat, stole softly to the door and pushed.</p>

<p class='c013'>The door was fast locked! He was a prisoner.</p>

<p class='c013'>For a moment the discovery of this fact, with all the consequences
to be deduced from it, almost paralyzed his energies!
But the next instant he had recovered his presence
of mind and activity of resources. He suddenly recollected
a chisel that had lain for days upon his mantle-shelf. It
was but the work of a few minutes to take that instrument,
and with it force back the catch of the lock and free himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>He then hurried softly through the dark and silent hall
and down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c013'>All below was mute and black as death and Erebus.</p>

<p class='c013'>Cautiously unfastening the hall door, he paced slowly
around the house until he found himself below the window
of Etoile’s boudoir. Against the wall leaned a ladder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“So far—well! Timon has been punctual in placing this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>means of escape at hand,” he thought. And ascending a
few of the rungs he called, in a soft tone:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss L’Orient! Miss L’Orient!”—and listened. But
no voice replied.</p>

<p class='c013'>He went up further and called out louder; but without
success.</p>

<p class='c013'>Growing very anxious, he ascended to the top of the ladder,
put his head in at the window, and called eagerly—
“Miss L’Orient!—Miss L’Orient!” But all was dark, and
cold, and still.</p>

<p class='c013'>“This is no time for false delicacy. She must forgive
me, since I mean well,” said Willful, very much alarmed, as
he turned himself in at the window, and grouped his way
through the boudoir, and through the adjoining chamber,
still calling on the name of Etoile. But neither sound nor
motion answered him; all was dark and silent as death and
the grave.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile was gone!</p>

<p class='c013'>Half frantic with terror, upon her account, Willful Brande
hurried through the window and down the ladder, and ran
with phrenzied haste straight on to the cabin of Timon, at
the door of which he knocked, imperatively, exclaiming:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Timon! Timon! are you there? What is the meaning
of this?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lor, gor, a-mity, Marse Willful, honey, come in, yerself!
I can’t move! I done tied hand and foot!” answered the
voice of the old man.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful pushed the door open and entered the cabin,
which was as dark as any other place in that dark night.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Feel on to de shelf dere for the match and de candle,
honey, and light it, and I done tell you all about it,” said
Timon’s voice, from the obscurity.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful found a match, and struck a light, that revealed
to him the form of poor old Timon, bound hand and foot
with strong cord and thrown upon the floor of his cabin.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>Without an instant’s delay he seized a sharp knife, cut the
cords, and helped the old man to his feet.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Now then what is the meaning of all this?” inquired
Willful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Couldn’t tell you, to save my life, Marster, only I reckon
how Marse Julius done found we-dem out, and outwitted us!
’Cause ’bout an hour ago, he done came here and throw me
down, and tie me, and leave me here without sayin’ of a
word.”</p>

<p class='c013'>A terrible idea occurred to Willful.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Come! follow me quickly! to the boat!” he said, and
rushed forth into the night.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old man hurried after as fast as age and infirmity
would permit.</p>

<p class='c013'>They reached Crystal Creek just in time, dimly to discern
that a boat had left the shore, and was now some quarter
of a mile out upon the bay.</p>

<p class='c013'>“He has carried her off! He would not have done it
by force, since that must have created a disturbance which
would have reached my ears! He has carried her off by
fraud. He will take her on board his chartered ship!
Quick! prepare a boat, and let us row for life! I will
follow her thither! I will board that ship! I will rescue
her or die!” exclaimed Willful, vehemently.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will be <em>die</em>, then, Marster; but nobody sha’n’t call
old Timon a coward in his old days,” said the poor creature,
who, with the air of a martyr, went to prepare the boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>But Willful would not let the old man risk his safety by
accompanying him. Alone he entered the light skiff, and
using both oars, propelled it swiftly over the water. He
could no longer see the other boat, but he rowed directly
for the distant ship, seen by the light at her prow, and
which he naturally supposed to be the chartered vessel of
Julius Luxmore.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>His light skiff flew like a sea-bird over the surface of the
bay, and quickly touched the side of the vessel.</p>

<p class='c013'>Without a moment’s hesitation he scaled the ladder, and
stood upon the deck, face to face with his sister, Barbara
Brande, whose barque had anchored there an hour before!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Willful!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Barbara!”</p>

<p class='c013'>They gazed upon each other in amazement for a moment,
and then rushed together in a hearty embrace.</p>

<p class='c013'>And while hurried explanations occupy them, we must
return to see what has become of Etoile.</p>

<p class='c013'>We said that, on reading Willful Brande’s note, with its
promise of speedy release, her heart had leaped with gladness.
But to follow its advice so far as to go to sleep, that
was impossible! There was no repose to her excited nerves
that night. However, the maiden was young and very
strong, and the loss of a single night’s rest would scarcely
be felt by her fine organization. So she blew out her light,
drew the bolts across her door, closed the blinds, and sat
down by the window to watch and wait from ten till two
o’clock. At eleven every one about the house had apparently
retired. At twelve it was to be supposed that all
were buried in sleep. And yet two hours remained of the
very “witching time” of night—hours, when all nature
seemed wrapped in death-like repose. Then she, every
nerve acute with listening, heard her name softly breathed
beneath her window. She silently opened the shutter and
murmured lowly—“Do not speak again. I am here.” And
taking her head in, she quickly put on her bonnet and mantle,
and reappeared at the window, against which a short
ladder had been leaned.</p>

<p class='c013'>A figure muffled in a large cloak, though this was July,
waited at the foot. Lightly Etoile descended the rounds,
where she was received by the man, who bowed, and making
a signal of silence, walked before. Etoile, with a rapidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>beating heart, followed. Both took the direction of the
Crystal Creek. The path was narrow, only one little pair
of feet having been accustomed to tread it. It led through
the densest portion of the thicket of woods that girdled
the Island.</p>

<p class='c013'>The guide went on in silence. Etoile followed—the palpitation
of her heart, the agitation of her whole frame, preventing
her from wishing to speak.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was still very dark, so that even when they emerged
from the thicket, the line of beach and the expanse of water
seemed only fainter shadow. The skiff moored in the little
creek looked only a blacker mark upon the dark water.
The boat was alone.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where are my servants? Are not Moll and Timon to
go with me?” inquired Etoile, for the first time speaking,
in a hushed voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>But her guide lifted up his finger to enjoin perfect silence,
and took her hand to assist her into the boat. A strange
misgiving upon account of the absence of her attendants
seized the heart of Etoile. But as no suspicion of treachery
mingled with her feelings, and as her confidence in Willful
Brande remained unshaken, she firmly stepped into the boat
and took her seat in the stern. Her companion followed,
sat down midway, and taking up the two oars began to ply
them. The boat glided swiftly over the still dark surface
of the creek out into the open Bay. The rower silently
directed its course toward the coast of Northumberland,
that lay due west. The guide continued mute, as though
he had been born dumb, and Etoile, now that she was alone
upon the waters with this reserved companion, from a feeling
of bashfulness remained quiet. Her misgivings increased.
There seemed to be no necessity now that they
were so far from land for this continued silence. It grew
oppressing, alarming; she became nervous, she could bear
the trial no longer, but spoke out, in a low agitated tone—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>very sound of her own voice amid the stillness frightening
her the more—inquiring—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande, excuse me, please, but where are my servants?
Why would they not come?”</p>

<p class='c013'>A low derisive laugh answered her!</p>

<p class='c013'>“My God! I am betrayed!” cried Etoile, with a stifled
shriek.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You are <em>entrapped</em>, fair plotter!” answered the voice
of Julius Luxmore.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, misery, misery! oh, God help me in my bitter extremity!”
she cried, in a voice of thrilling agony, burying
her face in her hands and dropping her head upon her
bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then followed a short pause, during which no sound was
heard but the dipping of the oars; Etoile remained half
stunned with sudden despair; Luxmore, scorned, repulsed
and enraged as he had been by her, now, with the vengeful
malignity of a fiend, gloated over the sight of her sufferings.
But already the heroic young spirit was struggling to rally
from the shock and throw off the benumbing weight of
despair.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What is the meaning of this, wretch?” at length she
asked, in rising indignation, as she lifted up her fair head.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will tell you, my beauty!” replied Luxmore, in a tone
of malignant triumph. “The meaning of this is, that I
suspected and watched your hopeful young guest, Willful
Brande; detected him in consultation with your other
‘guide, philosopher, and friend,’ old Timon; discovered
their plan to liberate you, and determined not only to <em>prevent</em>
it, but to avail myself of it, to get you more thoroughly
into my power. So I had old Timon quietly put in irons,
turned a key privately upon Master Willful, and offered
myself beneath your window as his substitute.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miscreant! why have you done this?” exclaimed the
young girl indignantly.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>“Do not call ill names, and I will tell you, my dear,”
replied Luxmore, with a deliberate softness of tone that
seemed to taste and chew the sweetness of revenge,—“I
will tell you, my beloved! While you remained on the
Island, you were in some measure out of my power, for
there were present a clergyman and a lawyer, to say nothing
of your lover, to protect you in an emergency. But having
detected you in the plot to leave the Island, I availed myself
of the opportunity of entrapping you! Your life and
honor are now absolutely at my mercy.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile clasped her fingers convulsively and threw her eyes
despairingly over the solitary waste of sky and water, as if
in hopeless appeal for help. In after years she remembered
the dark, silent, sombre scene, as if it had been daguerreotyped
forever on her brain. A single ship, dimly seen, lay
at anchor, a short distance off; a lantern burning at her
prow, threw a long line of light a cable’s length ahead, just
across their course.</p>

<p class='c013'>Withdrawing her eyes from this dreary prospect, she
turned them upon the dark figure of her guide.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Traitor! whither are you taking me?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will inform you, my sweet! To the Northumberland
coast, to a lonely cabin of which I keep the key; which
shall become the bower of my bride; and from which, when
she shall emerge, she will be but too happy to have the
state and church legalize and sanctify our union!” he answered,
with deliberate and demoniac malice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, who “understood a <em>horror</em> in his words, but not
the words,” started and recoiled to the furthest limits of
her seat. They were now approaching that long line of
light from the lantern in the prow of the ship at anchor
that lay in their way. She cast a startling glance at the
water beneath, and then a despairing gaze at the ship beyond.
Oh, that ship! so near, yet for all purposes of help,
so far!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>Julius Luxmore saw both look and gesture, and laughed
aloud, exclaiming scornfully—“Ah, pretty one! even you
see at length that you cannot escape me—‘in testimony
whereof, behold my hand and seal’”—and drawing in the
oars, regardless of the danger of rocking the boat he darted
toward her, and would have seized and embraced her; but
with a terrible cry, Etoile sprang into the sea, the waves of
which immediately closed over her form.</p>

<p class='c013'>So sudden, so startling, so appalling had been this act,
that Julius Luxmore for an instant remained panic-stricken,
but the next moment, he quickly threw off his coat, and
placed himself on watch for her reappearance.</p>

<p class='c013'>She arose above the surface of the water, at some distance
from the boat, nearer the ship, and attempted to strike out
bravely for the latter, but being embarrassed and weighed
down by her clothing, she made no progress, and even strove
in vain to keep afloat. Recovering from his first consternation,
and seeing her extremity, Julius Luxmore, with a
shout of vindictive triumph, urged his boat toward her
struggling form. In this unequal race he must soon have
reached and recaptured his prize; but that the next instant
a strong swimmer let himself drop from the bulwarks
of the ship, and struck out gallantly for the sinking girl,
whose form he seized, and bore victoriously to the starboard
gangway ladder, and up upon the deck of the—Ocean
Queen!—for this was the ship of Barbara Brande, which
had just an hour before dropped anchor here.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile, half suffocated and half exhausted, gave vent to
a convulsive sob, recovered her breath, looked up to thank
her brave preserver, and recognized Willful Brande!</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, may heaven repay you! but how should <em>you</em> be
here whom I thought detained upon the Island?” she exclaimed,
in a deeply agitated voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will inform you presently, young lady; now let me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>present you to my sister,” he replied, as Barbara Brande
advanced from the stern sheets.</p>

<p class='c013'>But before they met, at the instant of Willful’s speaking,
a boat touched the side of the vessel, and Julius Luxmore
sprung up the ladder, and stood upon the deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where is the girl you picked up, fellow? Deliver her
to me; she is my fugitive child!” he exclaimed, advancing
toward the group.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Save me! save me!” cried Etoile, springing for protection
to the bosom of Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Be composed, you <em>are</em> saved!” returned the deep, low
voice of the noble girl, as she folded one arm around the
shrinking form of the little maiden, and lifted the other
with outstretched hand to bar the nearer approach of the
intruder.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Give up that child instantly to her natural protector,”
he exclaimed, in a peremptory tone. It was as yet so dark
in this quarter of the vessel that, being still a few paces
distant, he had not recognized the persons to whom he
spoke.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Light the lanterns,” ordered Barbara, in that clear,
ringing, resonant voice that struck him as a sound familiar,
yet long unheard.</p>

<p class='c013'>And in another instant lights blazed from all parts of the
vessel, giving to full view all the persons on the deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>And Barbara Brande and Julius Luxmore stood face to
face! For a second, the traitor quailed before her calm,
clear, commanding gaze; but the next moment, rallying his
courage, with desperate assurance, he said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Deliver up my ward! I <em>insist</em> upon it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Insist then, by all means, since it amuses you to do so!”
replied Barbara, with cool contempt.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<em>Will</em> you give up my ward?” he demanded, with rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, certainly; how can you doubt it!” mocked Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Answer seriously, woman!”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>“It would be absurd to answer seriously, just as if you
had a right to ask!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Release that child, I command you, girl!” he exclaimed,
furiously.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How I should love to obey your command, especially
as I <em>adore</em> tyrants!” sneered Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Maddened with rage, he stole forward to seize the maiden.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Back, sir, at your peril!</span>” thundered Barbara, with
eyes blazing with defiance, and arm extended in command,
as she still sustained the maiden upon her broad bosom.</p>

<p class='c013'>Luxmore recoiled before the “embodied storm” he had
provoked.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful had sprung to the side of his sister, to protect
both her and her charge.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Stand aside, Willful, my son! Edwy, call all hands up!”
she ordered, in her customary, clear, resounding tones.</p>

<p class='c013'>And in a moment every man was on deck.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Listen now to me, Julius Luxmore. Regain the custody
of this girl you—can—not! either by law, force, or fraud!
You are free to depart in peace, and if, in two minutes, you
do not leave the ship, I will have you put in irons, and delivered
up to the nearest authority.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“By what right, lawless woman, do you <em>dare</em> do this?”
exclaimed Luxmore, in a voice of concentrated rage.</p>

<p class='c013'>“That is a question that I shall know how to answer before
the proper tribunal. You have heard the conditions
of your being permitted to depart in peace. One minute has
elapsed; with you I talk no more. Edwy, bring hither the
manacles,” she said, with quiet resolution.</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>She-Wolf!</span> you shall suffer for this!” cried Luxmore,
turning white as a leper, shaking his fist convulsively, and
grinding his teeth with fury, as he retreated down the ladder
to regain his boat.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Wrecked! wrecked! wrecked! worse than from the
deck of the Mercury! Lost! lost! lost! a girl’s dream
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>and a man’s soul!” murmured Barbara, unconsciously, in a
tone of deep anguish, as she watched his receding skiff.
Then, burying her despair deep in her own heart, she looked
upon her trembling charge, who still nestled to her bosom,
and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Look up, sweet girl! your tormentor has gone! You
are now quite safe. Come below and change your dress to
lie down and rest.”</p>

<p class='c013'>It was now growing light.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara took her charge down into the cabin; relieved
her of her dripping clothes; supplied their place with
loose and comfortable garments; made her drink a glass
of cordial, and led her to her own state-room to lie down
and sleep. But, before seeking repose, Etoile kneeled
beside the berth and silently offered up her thanks to
Heaven for the preservation of her life. Barbara lingered
until the little maiden had laid her head upon the pillow;
then kissed her, drew the cover over her shoulders, closed
the blinds, and stole softly out of the state-room.</p>

<p class='c013'>She crossed the cabin to an opposite door, and listened
to hear if there were any stirring within. The sound of
light footsteps and low voices met her ear. She rapped
softly, and the door was opened by Susan Copsewood.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Your lady is awake, Susan?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, Miss Brande, come in.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, come in, dear girl. I have been awake for hours,”
said the sweet voice of Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara entered, and sat down beside the berth where
the lady reclined.</p>

<p class='c013'>“The noise on deck, I suppose, awoke you, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“We were dropping the anchor and taking in sail. We
are near the Island,” said Barbara, who wished to prepare
her guest for the next good news.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Near the Island at last! It is now almost sunrise!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>How soon shall we be landed?” inquired Estelle, eagerly
rising upon her elbow, and flinging back the long black
ringlets that had escaped her cap and fallen—a shadowy
vail around her eloquent pale face.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may see your daughter Etoile within an hour,”
answered Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle’s countenance beamed with joy.</p>

<p class='c013'>“You may see her even sooner, if you can dress in less
time!” continued Miss Brande.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Susan, my dressing-gown! hand me my shoes! bind up
my hair! Dearest Barbara, I shall be ready as soon as you
can have the boat prepared,” said Estelle, leaving her
berth.</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is no need to prepare the boat,” said Miss
Brande, significantly.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh! Barbara, what mean you?” exclaimed the lady,
pausing in the preparation of her toilet, and gazing in an
agony of anxiety upon her friend.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Etoile is very near you.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Where? where?” cried Estelle, starting up and going
toward the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady, be calm and I will give you every satisfaction,”
replied Barbara, taking her hand and gently but firmly reseating
her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“One word—is she safe?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Safe, unmarried, unharmed, but also unprepared as yet
to meet her mother. Lady, listen. I will tell you every
thing, and—within half an hour, I will bring you to your
daughter.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, is it possible? Am I awake and in my senses? shall
I see Etoile?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“In less than half an hour! Compose yourself and
hear,” said Barbara, who then commenced and related all
the circumstances of the storm; the shipwreck; the saving
of Willful; the subsequent eclaircissement between Etoile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>and himself in respect to her guardian; the arrival of Luxmore;
the attempted flight of Etoile; the treachery to
which she was subjected; her abduction by Julius Luxmore;
her desperate escape and effort to swim to the ship; her
rescue by Willful Brande; the coming on board of Luxmore;
and, finally, the ignominious dismissal of the latter
from the ship. She concluded by saying—</p>

<p class='c013'>“And now, as I deemed it necessary that she should rest
before having another subject of excitement, I refrained
from speaking of her mother, and left her to repose.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande! oh, let me gaze upon her in her sleep!”
prayed the lady, clasping her hands.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will first see if she is sleeping, Madam,” replied Barbara,
leaving the state-room. In a few minutes she returned
and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“She is sleeping the deep sleep of exhaustion—you can
enter softly, lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>With a wildly beating heart and suspended breath, Estelle
passed into the opposite state-room, sat down beside the
berth, and gazed upon her daughter. Beautiful was that
sleeping image. One snowy arm doubled up on the pillow,
supported her blooming face; her white eyelids were
lightly closed over the violet eyes, the lashes lying delicately
penciled on her fresh rose cheeks; her golden hair flowed
in glittering disorder down ever forehead, side-face, and
bosom; her other arm drooped gracefully over the counterpane.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle gazed in a sort of still rapture upon her lovely
child, longing, yet afraid, ever so lightly to touch her. At
length the temptation to lay her lips upon that seraph face
grew irresistible, and light as the fall of a winter rose-leaf
on the snow, dropped the mother’s first kiss upon the
maiden’s pure brow. Soft as was the touch, Etoile felt it
in her sleep; her ruby lips parted in a smile; her eyelids
half unclosed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>Estelle, fearful of surprising her, arose and quietly withdrew
from the room.</p>

<p class='c013'>Half an hour after Barbara entered—Etoile was lying
wide awake, her rosy lips half parted, her violet eyes half
vailed in a dreamy smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How do you feel, my dear?” inquired Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Ah! Miss Brande, I have had such a sweet dream! so
seeming real, that I can scarcely dispel the illusion! I was
dreaming of my mother; I thought that she was living, and
that she had found me; I thought that she was sitting
by my bed, and oh! she was so beautiful! so beautiful!
just what I supposed her to be! just like the miniature I
painted of her, only so much more divinely beautiful! I
dreamed she stooped and pressed the softest kiss upon my
brow, and while her lips were upon my forehead, and her
soft black ringlets touched my cheeks, I awoke and found
it was all a dream! And yet, withal, it still seems so real,
that I can scarcely believe I dreamed,” said Etoile, closing
her eyes and smiling, as if to charm back the vision.</p>

<p class='c013'>“But suppose it was no dream, dear girl?” said Barbara,
in an agitated voice.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile’s eyes flared wide open, and her color went and
came.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Suppose it was reality—suppose that your mother really
did sit beside you in your sleep, and withdrew when you
awoke?”</p>

<p class='c013'>A tumultuous rush of emotion crimsoned and paled her
face, and took away her breath as she eagerly listened.</p>

<p class='c013'>“What if your mother had met with Madeleine in New
York, had heard of your existence and residence, and had
embarked on this very vessel to seek you at the Island?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, it is! it is so! I have seen my mother! I have
had her kiss!” cried Etoile, shaken, as a rose-tree is shaken
by a storm—“where, where, Miss Brande, where is she
now?”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>“Here, my beloved child! here, my long-lost darling,
here!” cried the voice of the lady, as she opened the door
and entered.</p>

<p class='c013'>Etoile sprung up in a sitting position, and threw herself
toward the lady, who opened her arms to receive her, and
murmuring—“Mother”—fell fainting upon her bosom. No
possible care could have prepared Etoile for a meeting like
this! It must necessarily have overwhelmed her.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Joy never kills—be not uneasy,” said Barbara, as she
lifted the fainting girl from the bosom of Estelle, and replaced
her on the berth. And indeed their united efforts
soon recalled the absent senses of their charge. Then Barbara,
with her eyes full of tears, withdrew and left the
mother and child together.</p>

<p class='c013'>Who can describe that first interview, indeed for many
reasons indescribable? But who can <em>not</em> picture to themselves,
the first tumultuous emotion; the strange, dreamy
joy; the first incoherent conversation; the sudden plunge
into the past history of each; the breathless questions
and answers; the impulsive embraces; the long, silent
pauses, with the form of the maiden pressed closely within
the arms of the mother; and at last the calmer hour, when
this strong emotion had subsided, and both sat quietly side
by side, comparing the story of their late lives, or rather
Etoile giving up the whole of hers to her mother’s earnest
inquiries.</p>

<p class='c013'>Like two lovely sisters they looked, the one so dark, the
other so fair, yet both alike in features, form and air, and
both so surpassingly beautiful!</p>

<p class='c013'>The prophecy of both hearts was now fulfilled. The
mother had found her child—the child her mother! And
for the time being the whole world was forgotten.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara long delayed the breakfast; but when the hour
of nine arrived, she thought that even for the good health
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>of those two absorbed creatures, she should call them. So
going to the state-room door, she rapped, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Breakfast awaits your leisure, lady.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“I thank you, Miss Brande,” said the voice of Estelle
who immediately opened the door, and led her daughter
to her own state-room, where Susan Copsewood waited.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Little shipwrecked maiden, you must wear your
mother’s dress,” said the lady, as she seated the girl on the
side of the berth. Then seeing Susan, she added—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Etoile, this young woman is the faithful friend of whom
I told you, Susan, speak to my child.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But poor, good Susan, was too deeply moved to speak,
and only took the hand of the maiden, raised it to her lips
and burst into tears. Etoile pressed <em>her</em> hand and looked
gratefully in her face. Then with affectionate zeal, Susan
dressed her “young lady” as she termed her mistress’s
daughter. And soon they passed out to breakfast. The
table was spread in the cabin, Barbara presided over the
coffee service.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I miss some one here—my favorite, Willful, now doubly
dear to me as the preserver of my daughter’s life. Where
is he, Miss Brande?” inquired the lady, as she took her seat
at the board.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Willful refrains from intruding, yet I know he would be
happy to pay his respects to you, Madam,” answered Barbara.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Then pray have him called.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Edwy arose from his place and summoned his brother.</p>

<p class='c013'>Willful entered the cabin, bowing. The lady looked up
and held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Brande, all human words and thanks are poor and
weak to express how much I owe you for the protection of
this child. God grant that in the future, Willful, I may be
able to prove what I now feel!” said the mother, as her
bosom heaved and her eyes overflowed.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>Willful, with much grace, lifted the hand of the lady respectfully
to his lips, and said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam, I am more blessed than I ever deserved to be,
in having been, in ever so humble a degree, able to serve
you, and——” he paused suddenly and sent a swift, shy
glance at Etoile. The lady followed that glance and saw
the quick blushes of both youth and maiden as their eyes
met. She saw and understood and thought—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Is it so? Well, well, he has saved her life and honor!
Let him keep the fair promise of his youth! Let him be
worthy of her, and when a proper time comes he shall have
her!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Sit down, Willful, and take a cup of coffee,” said his
sister, to break up an embarrassing pause. He seated himself
and the breakfast went forward.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the morning meal was over, there was a consultation
in the cabin.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It will be necessary for you, lady, to go to the county-town
to take certain legal steps to enable you to assume
the guardianship of your daughter and her patrimony.
The county-town is Eastville, which, you know, lies back
of my old home, the Headland. Therefore, if you please,
we will steer directly for the Headland.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The lady eagerly acquiesced. And in half an hour the
anchor was got up and the ship set sail for her new destination.</p>

<p class='c006'>At eleven o’clock the Ocean Queen cast anchor off the
Headland. The long-boat was lowered, and the mother
and daughter, with Barbara and her two brothers, entered
it and were rowed across to the beach. They landed, and
began to ascend the bank. At the top they overtook old
Neptune, with a basket of soft crabs in his hand. His
mistress took him aside and spoke to him.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Has any one come, Neptune?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lors yes, chile, come dis mornin’—four, five, ever so
fine folks, an’ the fine English lords as was here some years
back. Amphy, she done gone up to get dinner. I gwine
carry up de fish now.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Very well, go on,” said Barbara, who then returned to
the side of Estelle. They were approaching the house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“It appears to me that the place is occupied,” said Estelle.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Madam—yes, it is occupied temporarily.”</p>

<p class='c013'>They ascended the steps, and paused a moment at the
door.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady,” said Barbara, “you have fine nerves, and the
great self-control that they give—exert it now.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>“Miss Brande, what mean you?” inquired Estelle, in some
alarm.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I told you that your parents were seeking you!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes—well?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“They are not far off. Come into your old bed-chamber
and lay off your bonnet, and compose yourself for a few
minutes,” said Miss Brande, opening the door, and conducting
Estelle and her daughter into a back room. Then,
while they arranged their dress, she passed into the parlor
and closed the door after her. And though a lady of distinguished
presence and three gentlemen occupied the room,
she lifted her finger to her lip as a sign of silence, and advanced
straight up to the youngest of those gentlemen. He
arose to receive her, saying, in a low voice:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“Miss Brande, your letter has brought not only myself
but, as you see, our whole party—Sir Parke, Lady Morelle,
and Dazzleright. Oh, Barbara, surely you could not hold
out any but a certain hope.”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Speak softly, Lord Eagle Tower. She is not far off.
She does not know your presence here.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Sir Parke, who had also approached the spot where she
stood, heard this piece of news, and reeled as if he would
have fallen. Lady Morelle hastened to his side, and led
him to the nearest seat, wiped the beaded drops from his
brow, and held her vinaigrette to his nostrils. Her ladyship
had, certainly, the most self-command of the whole
party. As soon as the enfeebled old father recovered his
composure, Barbara took Lord Eagle Tower aside and
said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“I will bring her in now. You and Lord Dazzleright
had best retire for a few minutes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>He nodded—he could scarcely speak—for he too was
very much shaken.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara slipped through the door, and met face to face
<span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>with Estelle, who was standing there as rigid and as white
as marble, with her eyes turned toward the parlor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara closed the door, took her hand, and led her a
little way back into the chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Lady—dear Madam, what is the matter?”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Montressor! Montressor!—If ever I heard Montressor’s
voice, I heard it just now! Oh, it was so low, yet I heard it!”</p>

<p class='c013'>“Yes, you heard it. Compose yourself, dear lady. Summon
your great strength, and go in! Leave Miss L’Orient
here with me a moment;” and she opened the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>Estelle passed through, and entered the shadowy parlor—the
tumult of her mind causing the scene to swim before
her—so that at first she could not distinguish persons.</p>

<p class='c013'>But an aged form tottered toward her, and fell upon her
neck, saying:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Oh, Estelle, my child! my child! can you pardon your
old father?”</p>

<p class='c013'>She sank at his feet, and kissed his hands, and said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“Forgive and bless <em>me</em>, my father.”</p>

<p class='c013'>But Sir Parke, the subdued and broken old aristocrat,
could only weep and lift her up, and hand her over to her
mother, who, with a burst of tears, received her in her arms.
Estelle sat down between them both, upon the sofa, and
wept while she pressed her mother’s hand, or stroked her
father’s cheek, and told them of the long-lost child that she
too had recovered. Then Etoile was brought in, and presented
to her grandparents, who contemplated her beauty
with pride and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c013'>But at last Lady Morelle said:</p>

<p class='c013'>“There is another who is waiting to see our Estelle.
Come, Sir Parke, take your grandchild in your hand and
let us pass into the adjoining room, and give this faithful
friend an opportunity to plead his cause.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The baronet arose, and leading Etoile and accompanied
by his wife, passed into the back chamber.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>Estelle sank upon the sofa—the beating of her heart was
almost audible.</p>

<p class='c013'>A moment passed and Lord Eagle Tower was in the
room and at her side.</p>

<p class='c013'>What was first said on either side, they could not have
told!—how should another? It was a most agitated, tumultuous
interview, in which all that either learned at first
was, that neither heart was changed toward the other. Lord
Eagle Tower learned the meaning of the sacrifice that she
had made. And she discovered the supererogatory nature
of her long self-immolation.</p>

<p class='c013'>And finally he said—</p>

<p class='c013'>“My Estelle! my love! my wife! deemed you that ever
<em>I</em> could forget <em>you</em> and marry? I! Oh, my own! all these
years of absence have you only taken root deeper and
deeper into my heart! become more and more knitted to
my soul! My wife! my innermost self, not now, not to-day
only, but always and forever, from eternity to eternity,
my own! Oh, suffering one! and did you think
that time or absence had power to steal <em>you</em> from my
heart, or that another could ever fill your place there? Impossible
in fact! sacrilegious in theory! No, Estelle; no,
dearest wife! my heart’s innermost treasury! no. I lived
amid a pageantry of beautiful and attractive women, as
lovely, perhaps, as my Estelle. But not one among them
was mine, or ever could be mine, because my heart was
abundantly filled. I moved among them, my eyes enjoying,
in common with others, the sight of their beauty and grace,
but without the slightest wish to appropriate any among
them. I moved amid the beautiful, even as though I had
been a happy husband, with his whole heart filled, his whole
nature abundantly satisfied with the wife of his choice.
For my heart was full of the love of my only possible wife,
though her presence lighted another hemisphere.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Draw the vail. The full interview between such hearts
<span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>so deeply tried, so long severed, so unexpectedly reunited,
is almost too sacred for description.</p>

<p class='c013'>But little more remains to be told.</p>

<p class='c013'>That same afternoon, a messenger, sent to Heathville,
brought back the worthy Doctor Goodloe with a special
license, and before the set of sun Estelle became Lady Eagle
Tower.</p>

<p class='c013'>They remained a few days at the Headland, during which
Lady Eagle Tower applied for, and received, full powers
of guardianship over the person and property of her child.
It is needless to say that that child was received with paternal
affection by Lord Eagle Tower.</p>

<p class='c013'>In a few days they set sail for Washington, where Lord
Eagle Tower received dispatches appointing him to proceed
at once to the Court of —— upon certain diplomatic
business. He immediately obeyed the order and departed,
accompanied by his lady and her whole family. Willful
Brande was to visit them there, whenever his professional
duties would permit him to do so. Lord Dazzleright renewed
his proposition to the beautiful Amazon, but Barbara
gratefully and firmly declined the man and the coronet.</p>

<hr class='c019'>

<p class='c013'>Susan Copsewood married Mr. Gridley, Lord Eagle
Tower’s “gentleman,” and both continue in the service of
their former master and mistress. Susan has entirely recovered
from her transient fear of ghosts, and is even more
incredulous than ever upon the subject of the reappearance
or departed spirits; for, in several confidential conversations
with her mistress, she discovered that the supposed
apparition of the spirit of Blanche Brande, that
haunted the old family burial-ground, and peeped in at her
window, was no other than her own dear lady, Estelle, who,
restless from grief, had nightly left her sleepless couch to
spend an hour or two in wandering through the solitary
groves.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>Years have flown. Lord and Lady Eagle Tower reside
in great splendor, surrounded by their interesting family, at
the Eastern Court, where he is resident minister. The fate
of Luxmore is unknown.</p>

<p class='c013'>Barbara Brande still sails upon the sea, and promises to
leave it only when her brother Willful, who is now a commander
in the navy, shall be united to his promised bride—Etoile
L’Orient, the lovely Lady of the Isle.</p>
